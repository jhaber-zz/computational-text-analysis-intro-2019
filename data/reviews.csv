1,4,The Killer Count Just Keeps Rising,0.88,When I first threw this on I really didnt know what to expect. Shortly there after I was very pleased to hear some great metal. Hailing from Argentina| this band on a whole seems to have very proficient| and just cool members/ musicians that are quite talented. There are many| many different musical directions on this album| and I wouldnt exactly know as to what to classify them as simply (well other than some killer metal tunes). There are traditional thrash riffs| almost heavy metal riffs| palm muted jumpy rythm type riffs| speed picked arpeggios| and lots of other little things you can pick up on. The bass sound is also another fine example why this bands kicks as much ass as they do. Maintaining a very clean| and deep tone| with most parts not haveing any distortion on the bass I can really get into this since it is so well done. A strong originality (or basically a unique band sound) pummels you into a creative mesh of late 80's early| 90's influenced true metal.The vocals vary from typical black metal screams| to death backing growls| to cool hatefull voices| and clean harmonies in the back ground. A wide| and well arranged variety| keeping pace with what the rest of the album on a whole displays| it has to offer the listener a sadisitic (painfull? I dont know cause I cant read the lyrics) raw element other than the badass guitar playing. There are alot (this isnt breaking records| but really they got some talent) of riffs on here| and alot of those really remind of the band Death. With that said| there are also many parts that sound very original and unlike the previously stated similiar artist| but probably a big influence| as I would guess King Diamond and Carcass would fall into that category for them. I'd also like to note that the intro in the 3rd song is very remniscent to a Maiden lead| but than breaking into an old school thrash sound shortly there after going into a Black thrash sound. The break down in the 5th song also really stands out thanks to a killer bass riff that just projects the guitar chords| which are played over it| right into your head banging fucking skull till you trash to death and breathe no more (there should be a warning).These songs on here have many different aspects| and are very well written (I must sound like a broken record| but I cant state that point enough cause its very true). One reason I really like this album is due to the variety| and sheer number| of all the riffs| and if that wasnt enough the harmonies and solos over them are total head banging true metal.I highly recommend this to Thrash| Death| and fans of heavier progressive metal. This is a killer release. Get it. NOW!!!
2,5,A gem of heterogeneous death metal...,0.96,"Several years ago I bought from a band member| the band’s frontman Alejandro I think| all the albums that he had available for sale at that time and among them| sent me the last CD of Genesis & Horror. It was a pretty fortunate coincidence| since I heard them all and this seemed the best. Years have passed since then and I still hold that view.The album opens with an evocative intro by acoustic guitars and flutes| very successful| which after one minute and half ends and rush quickly to what will bring us this entire album: sort of progressive death metal with hints of black metal and even some brief acoustic and/or atmospheric parts. As noted in that definition| the music is very eclectic| hard to fit in a single genre| but at least we can still mention influences of Opeth| Death| and perhaps a little Emperor in some cuts between riffs. I am not a scholar in death metal; it’s a genre that I usually step aside (and despise)| so it is likely that here are some other names that escape me. However| here we find double pedal bass drums| guitars and basses played in tremolo picking| but never saturating and inserting mid-paced and/or atmospheric parts here and there. What is the most attracting of all this it’s that the mix is very balanced and very well done| to the point that those possible influences of the band melt together in a new unity and you could safely say at the end of the CD that the band got their own unique sound.The songs ""Agonico Order"" and ""El arte de ser decadencia"" acquired the status of classics in my book. They’re death metal with melodic parts and memorable atmospheric pieces with acoustic guitar chords and hammering double pedal bass drums. Programmed drums| but except in some minor parts it goes totally unnoticeable.The voice is quite good| in my opinion closer to the field of black metal than the typical death metal guttural scream. One might note that would be half way between Abbath and Ihsahn: certain monochromatic vein in the singing with momentary (few) more low pieces. The lyrics are clearly understandable for spanish speaking metalheads which would be a bad point with at least 80% of the death metal bands (whose lyrics are often silly| tautological and / or sort of teenager) but not here with 1917. The lyrics have varied images and resources as they speak of nihilism| anger and disappointment (with surreptitious social and cultural criticism).In short: a great job of death / black metal surprisingly mixed in a successful and evocative way; my personal favourite full length of the band and totally recommendable."
3,8,Fantasic| if mostly for its influences,0.83,What a wonderful release this is. ‘Vox Fatum’ is a real mix of styles that complement each other to the fullest| one of those releases that acknowledges all its musical influences without compromising its overall sense of direction. Certain moments display the heavy groove and thump of a Finnish death metal record| whilst others adopt the intricate weaving and melody of ‘God Was Created’ era Vehemence| added to the over-arching energy and grit of early Morbid Angel combine to form an album that is not only well rounded but feels familiar in its musical concept and content.Oddly| though| if I were asked to explain why I enjoy this CD so much| my reasons prove to be quite elusive| as I sometimes struggled to differentiate between 1917 and the bands that they take influence from. Is it as simple as “I enjoy ‘Vox Fatum’ because I also enjoy Morbid Angel”? Well| no| not quite| as this would do a disservice to 1917’s song writing ability| but at the same time the influence of such groups feels so present to me throughout this album that failure to recognise it would be to ignore a huge element in 1917’s identity as a band. I mean| there are many riffs on this record that are not only styled around Morbid Angel| but it feels slightly weird that they haven’t already been written by Morbid Angel themselves| to the extent that I fail to understand how the intro riff to ‘Legado Sombrio’ is somehow NOT included in ‘Domination’. HOW is ‘La Iniquidad Penitente Pt.II’ NOT somewhere on ‘Altars of Madness’? That aside| the songs here are fantastic| all of them| each bringing a different feel to the album. Aforementioned opener ‘Legado Sombrio’ is a track that happily serves as the perfect metaphor for the entire album; fast in some parts| dark and groovy in others| complete with melodic passages and impassioned| snarled vocals. ‘Trofeos de Honor’ places more emphasis on groove| ‘Sobrevivir Para el Dolor’ is more progressive in the vein of later Akercocke| while ‘Crepusculo de los Hombres’ reverts right back to the thrashier side of Morbid Angel and| oddly| a generous and welcome moment of Kreator. I would normally talk more about the actual genre of metal the band plays and how successful they are in delivering it| but ‘Vox Fatum’ genuinely does feel more of an endorsement of the music of other bands. By saying that| I hope I haven’t managed to dissuade people from going out and buying this CD| because that I what I would sincerely recommend doing. Being influenced by the aforementioned bands is a very good thing| and such influence has never been better executed than on this album. If you are not a fan of later Morbid Angel| then ‘Vox Fatum’ should go some way to serve as a worthy extension of their earlier work.
4,45,A rare| lost hidden gem,0.8,"Picture this: crushing| brutal death metal| with all the hallmarks of the genre. Crushing| brutal grooves. Extreme vocals. Double-bass drumming.Now mix it with slap-happy funk basslines and '70s-style groove sections that would make Bootsy Collins proud. Add a dash of ""yo yo boy"" wigger lyrics on top and mix it all together.On paper| this should be a catastrophe. Instead| somehow| it all comes together and provides an extreme metal listening experience unlike any other band I've discovered... and all this from some totally unknown band out of New Mexico that doesn't appear to have done anything before or after this record. The funk and metal sections are largely separate| and switch back and forth between the two in a sometimes jarring juxtaposition| but it's precisely these sudden gear shifts that keep the record from plodding. It's certainly a different take on the formula| and at under 30 minutes| the record doesn't over-stay its welcome.If you're looking for a pure| unadulterated death metal record| there are plenty of those out there. If you've been listening to death metal for twenty years and your ears are desperate for something different... seek out this CD. I found mine at random in a used record shop and bought it for the princely sum of $2 based on the logo and cover alone. Its unique qualities mean that it's a CD I'll reach for long after the latest Immolation clone has lost all interest for me... even if I really could do without the ""yo yo muthafucka""-isms scattered throughout!"
5,54,Pure| but flayed and covered in soot,0.92,"Abhordium's When Depravity Incarnates is an extremely positive surprise in virtually every respect. Death metal in general seems like a genre flogged to death by gazillions of more or less crappy bands in the recent years| and this particular album brings were little innovation to the table. It has not been released by a label| and in a world deluged by independent releases of questionable quality| creating a full-length indie release is both financial gambling and| too often| an artificial support for the musicians' egos.However| in this case| everything seems to click to place in a surprising way| and the album is a very enjoyable piece of controlled chaos| and manages to renew the traditional genre| but without turning to commercial crap or disrespecting the classic rules of death metal. Even the packaging| a very nice looking digipack| with creepily innovative band member pictures and overall well-designed looks| promises something that deviates from the flow of mediocre works in the genre.The music on When Depravity Incarnates is almost pure death metal| with a traditional but modernized sound| dashes of brutality| and the chaotic essence of the genre well under control. The riffing is extremely well executed| rapid| and sounds somewhat like a modernized| sped-up Altars of Madness. And that is what death metal should be about. The songs are logical and flow extremely well| but still retain the vital chaotic battering whirlwind of true death metal| with absolutely no core influence whatsoever; the songs are carried mostly by the wonderful guitar-work| and that's exactly how it should be. Rule #1 of death metal: riffs before everything!The vocals are basic death growls| the drumming is almost exceptionally faithful to the conventions of the genre| and the bass serves the greater good as it should. There's a scent of brutal death metal in the air| but that's mostly because the album takes the traditional death metal to the extreme| and has a brutality of the original kind| without the annoying characteristics of the modern run-of-the-mill brutal death. Some of the rapid riffing also carries a mildly blackened feel to it| as do the vocals and lyrics on the last track| ""Abyss Portal""| even if the music stays true to death metal.Production-wise the album is close to perfect. The sound is thick| but not Hi-Fi| and just the drums get a bit buried by the combined efforts of the guitars and vocals occasionally. However| even the production respects the original definition of death metal| and there's simply nothing to whine about… this is a very good album. For an independent release| When Depravity Incarnates is a very professional and credible package in every way. Most death metal albums released by labels nowadays is much less enjoyable than Abhordium on this fine piece of work| and even if there's nothing new on the album| the extreme traditionalism and purity of death metal is easily enough to make this a worthwhile purchase.And finally| the band displayed some original innovation in their marketing efforts. Going around a festival area and selling the album out of a backpack to random metalheads drinking beer on the lawn is a traditional method to spread independent releases. However| the simple addition of an MP3 player and quality headphones for some quick sampling was quite enough to convince yours truly of the bargain.When Depravity Incarnates is a worthy purchase for anyone into traditional death metal taken into one kind of extreme. It's also a schoolbook example of how to release an independent album the right way. Listen and learn!"
6,62,Not an abomination by any means,0.65,Yep| you read it right| this is Abominattion (two 't's). Not to be confused with the US thrashers of yore who lucked out with the correct spelling; this is the cult Brazilian four piece of noise mongers. 'Doutrine of False Martyr' is the band's 2nd effort| which is re-issued here with two bonus tracks tacked on from their various demos (when they went under the moniker 'Anesthesia'). When this album was originally released in 2001| it was only available on a small Brazilian label and was limited to 500 copies| hence the re-issue on Animate Records of Germany. Starting off the album is the nicely clichéd sample of gusting winds| explosions and chattering birds that eventually gives way to a massive kick into overdrive from the off. Ultra-fast hammered-on scale notes played in triplets| almost exactly like their country mates Krisiun blasting through your speakers at a rate of knots. Krisiun is definitely the best comparison sound-wise| with hints of similarly Brazilian domiciled Rebaellion in the lightning speed guitar solos| and (of course) a healthy dose of good old Morbid Angel worship when the tempo does occasionally decrease in the slower octave chord guitar lines of various tracks on offer here. Although there is hardly any let up in the speed of the guitars| the drums are not all blast-ridden| allowing the catchy rhythms and clarity of guitar playing to shine through and the music as a whole is given plenty of much needed breathing space as a result. It's not a secret| but when you play this style of metal| you need to be technically proficient with your instruments| or it will show glaringly on plastic (luckily these guys are pretty decent at what they do). My favourite track has to be the title track of the album| where they notably intersperse open string tremolo dive bombs a la Morbid Angel| seasoning the chaos nicely and adding depth when needed. This helps to stop the proceedings from just becoming a full on 'washing machine' blast-fest. Also notable is the near two minute intro to the track 'The Unholy March'| which consists of what sounds like a singular guitar doing super speedy runs with a harmoniser on. While nothing jaw dropping technically| it's still fairly impressive (it's the sort of thing you see old men doing in guitar shops trying to show off!) and it leads into an excellent Morbid Angel styled instrumental| complete with booming drums and low tuned guitars. All in all| while they won't be stealing any crowns just yet with this re-release| they are a pretty respectable band who you could do a lot worse than checking out in my estimations Originally written for www.metalcrypt.com
7,62,Repetitive Background Watery Death,0.5,"Horrific spelling skills aside| Abominattion's album ""Doutrine (?) of (a) False Martyr"" is a vicious Brazillian death metal attack| but unfortunately it lacks the variation that would have made a killer disc.Instead of exploring slower tempos| different sounds| or anything other than fast Fast FAST balls to the wall DM| the band has released an album destined to immediately sink into the pool of generic death metal. Yes| it is easiest to think of the death metal genre as a pool| or maybe a big dirty lake with zombies in it like in that Italian horror movie. Individual bands are like objects thrown into the lake - if they are absolute originators (and very talented)| they will float| and other bands will desparately try to cling to these life rafts to avoid the watery depths. Pretty soon you have a style that comes close to being a subgenre. Soon too many bands jump on board| and the whole thing starts to submerge. Either the hangers-on drown| and a few bands at the center survive| or the whole oversaturated thing enjoys a few lungfulls of water before their existence ends.So| what was the point of that? Got me. Oh yeah| Abominattion is another Morbid Angel soundalike| minus the originality or the willingness to experiment that has made MA so enduring. Every once in a while this disk completely kicks ass| like ""Reigning in the Impure Blood."" But the ass is only kicked by slowing down the guitars and playing sludgy riffs while the double bass pumps away in the background| ala (guess who?) Morbid Angel. Some tracks remind me of Cannibal Corpse too| but not in a good way.So while you can sit and listen to this| don't be too surprised if you look up and two or three tracks have passed without you noticing. Actually| the last two bonus tracks on the Animate Records release are pretty cool. It shows the band being a little more wild and experimental - and while there are a few flaws (vocal| drums| production) - it shows a far more creative band. I wish they had stuck with this style. But they didn't| so I guess it's a combination to Davey Jones' locker for these metalheads."
8,65,Good For a Debut,0.76,For a debut album| this is surprisingly good. The simple fact of being a debut has a tendency to lower my expectations| but these songs generally hold up pretty well. Purity also proves wrong some of my initial assumptions about the band's progression. The actual enjoyment of the music itself is derived from the faster portions which| thankfully| are frequent.Starting with some fringe elements| the cover is awful. A fake-looking woman splattered is cheesy in a bad way although Aborted never really seemed to stumble upon awesome covers| and this isn't their worst. Like a fossil in the desert| their aforementioned musical development is shown to be much different than I had envisioned prior. With Goremageddon and it's melodic leads as my initial exposure to Aborted| my imagined starting point for this band was closer to that of Impaled. This is most certainly not like Impaled| and it isn't even much like Carcass. No| Aborted here is much closer to brutal death metal bands such as Skinless| albeit with a less crushing sound. There isn't anything innately wrong with this| but it was unexpected to say the least. Lastly| the intros are longer and more frequent than would be ideal. This is already barely half an hour| but a full five or so minutes is composed of filler that isn't all that interesting.Production on Purity is not as good as it should be. Debuts frequently have this problem| and it's not that bad| but the music would have been better served with slightly clearer production. The most obvious instances are when the songs open up with a fast riff| and they are cloudy to start with. Particularly compared to their most recent album| Sven is a much| much smaller piece of the sound. Guitars are definitely up-front with everything else trailing. Mileage will vary on all this| though I do believe that Sven's place in the mix is a plus of the album.Many point to Sven's vocals as maybe the strongest aspect of the band| but I'm not sure about that. His voice alternates between a deep growl that almost sounds like he's coughing and some sharp screeches that bring to mind a harsher Doty. Occasionally| some Walker-esque| puking vocals are thrown in though they're not sustained for as long as was heard on Reek or Symphonies. Sven convey's their message well| but this talk of him as a really great vocalist is excessive. The lyrics present are somewhat simpler than would be read later on. Act of Supremacy| the first real track| is closer to what Barnes wrote for Cannibal Corpse than it is to what Walker penned on the early Carcass albums. The usual Hellraiser nod is to be found on the very next song| The Lament Configuration. Lament also contains the line “reek of putrefaction|” and is the most overt of several Carcass references.Purity is largely fast| again where the quality is at| but parts of the songs do slow down and often with a breakdown. These breakdowns aren't too frequent| but they occur often enough to bring the music down somewhat. Other than these mild annoyances| the guitar playing is very satisfying. Regardless of pace| Niek and Herre enjoy tossing in random squeals| and their tremolo riffs are nearly always good. The riffing on display is pretty atonal| but their dissonance is delicious. Atonality as the rule is very different from many other Aborted albums| yet this is the style that they started with. Neither of these guys were there by the third album| so the change can be understood| but it's interesting nonetheless.This is a solid| though surprising| start to Belgium's finest. Many aspects have carried through| such as the breakdowns and Hellraiser homages| while others have been supplanted| their playing is less atonal. The Purity of Perversion hasn't been reviewed yet| which is a little odd. This is a fair release from a band that is pretty well-known and liked. A slightly clearer sound| a couple more good songs| and fewer breakdowns are all this album would need to be a very good release. A bigger fan of breakdowns might even feel that this is already very good. Any Aborted fan should have this| and a death metal fan should at least hear it.
9,66,Unrelenting fucking bruality,0.9,Aborted are one of the bands that got me into brutal death metal. This album and Goremageddon are some of their greatest works for sure. But I guess I am in the minority when I say that I like this album better than Goremageddon. Yes| yes I know Goremageddon had its moments| but it did not have the pounding brutality that this album has. I dare even say that the production is weaker as well. On this album you will hear sickening vocals| pounding drums| prominent bass and destructive riffing. The artwork is a bit odd looking to me| but the music absolutely makes up for it. The first thing that I noticed when I first heard Aborted was Sven. The guy just fucking nails it every time (except for that album of their's that we don't mention around here). He doesn't sound like anyone else| and nobody else sounds like him. He yells and growls throughout this album| tearing his throat out and delivering the brutality as a verbal crowbar assault. I don't think that any of his future (or past| seeing as how they had one album before this one) performances will ever match this one. The guitars and bass are ridiculous. The riffing is well done and| even though it generally follows the guitars the whole time| the bass playing is also well done. My favorite song| To Roast and Grind| truly displays what these guys are capable of when it comes to downright kicking you in the ass with ruthlessness. The drumming is also excellent| despite not being terribly remarkable. The guy gets the job done and he knows what he is doing. Unlike many brutal death metal albums that suffer from trash-can drum syndrome| the drum tone on this album is sufficient and isn't weak or thin by any means. While this isn't my favorite brutal death metal album| it is not a bad album. It isn't even a good album| its excellent. The guys over in Belgium clearly knew what they were doing on this one and it shows for sure. Their latest album tries to recapture some of their old insanity| but you know what they say| you can't capture lightning twice.
10,66,Just tapping the potential,0.75,My introduction to this band was Nailed Through Her Cunt| which is track 2 on this release. However| I didn't start with this album. I got Goremageddon instead. It was only after becoming familiar with the three Aborted albums that followed this that I gave it a try. While Nailed Through Her Cunt is an outstanding brutal death metal song| the rest of it isn't quite up to scratch. Don't get me wrong| this is still a great Aborted album| but the band would do so much better later.I'll start with the vocals. Svencho is as good as here as he's ever been. Providing incomprehensible gurgles and grunts and effortlessly switching to higher shouted vocals easily. He uses both styles effectively to show more of a personality and prevent the music from getting monotonous. A lot of brutal death metal vocalists usually use one continous growl and gets very dull and has no character.The riffs are almost thrashy and Slayer influences| while the band also resort to slow breakdowns. These breakdowns are technical and well played and are only needed when the music needs to slow down and take a break from the fast punishing riffs.Drumwork is blazing fast with lots of blast beats and technical fills. The drums keep the music going at the right pace| as drums are supposed to.The production is quite raw| but not so much that it becomes unlistenable. Everything is clear (minus the bass| which can be only just heard through decent headphones) but it's quite fuzzy| but I don't let it bother me.The only real flaw is the memorability factor. Minus Nailed Through Her Cunt| not much of it outstanding. Granted this was only their second album| but there was potential to do much better| which they did with follow up effort Goremageddon. Well worth getting if you're a fan of the band| but if not| get the next 3 (Goremageddon| Archaic Abattoir| Slaughter and Apparatus) first.
11,66,The Unbridled Fury of An Ethnic Cleansing,0.89,"Within the now ominous environment and concrete walls of Auschwitz| there is buried a skull fragment of a Jewish man named Yakim Beregin. Yakim was stabbed to death by Nazi guards after trying to smuggle food to a relative punished by starvation. Before he died| Yakim looked through his blood filled cornea's and saw Hell open it's black gates to his soul. Inside was a furious caterwauling that could only be classified as Death Metal| namely ""Engineering the Dead"" by a band labeled Aborted.From the very start of this album and ""The Holocaust Incarnate""| the listener is given the aural gas chamber with a fast paced low scale riff section that evaporates into a mass grave of low tuned madness. During the album| the dual axe wielders synchronize themselves with deadly precision and signature groove heavy melodies| rife with tempo changes. Songs like the self titled track| the aforementioned ""The Holocaust Incarnate""| ""Nailed Through Her Cunt""| and ""Skullfuck Crescendo"" are perfect examples of this almost Saturday Night Fever style groove fest. Never fear though Devourment fans| Aborted didn't sacrifice brutality for melody| as you'll find a nice heavy section to your liking in ""Eructations of Carnal Artistry""| and another near the latter portion of ""Sphinctral Enthrallment"" which| ironically| is my favorite song of the album.As for the man behind the kit| the drums meet nearly all expectations set for them. We hear many examples of Frank utilizing rolls| blast beats aplenty| and tackling difficult tempo adjustments with ease. Take heed of the massive drum section near the end of ""Sphinctral Enthrallment"". Now close your eyes for a second and picture your face where his snare would be. If you don't open your eyes screaming from the image of your facial bones fractured and your jaw mangled beyond recognition| I believe you have no pulse and should be cremated at once. As always| Sven belts out a multi-toned| low to high| vocal bludgeoning. The song ""Nailed Through Her Cunt"" really accentuated the range and vocal capacity Sven has in him as well as his ability to groove right along with the music as his lyrics provided. I cannot stress this song enough at slumber party sing-alongs.Leaving no skull unsmashed| and no body un-unburied| this quintet from Beveren| Belgium improved upon their powerful debut to produce one hell of a sophomore album. More so than any other Aborted album| the songwriting flourished in a way not duplicable. The rhythms and melodies were purposely set to give many sections a place to collapse into heavy low toned riffage and upscale melodies| translating in lay man's terms to a headbangers delight. Without a doubt| this is Aborted's finest hour| and is recommended for any fan of Death Metal with more groove than John Travolta's parachute pants and more brutality than an all snuff film festival."
12,66,Engineering the Dead,0.93,"Well| Aborted seemed to have matured a fuckload with this LP. Everything is tighter| Sven's vocals are more mature and consistently more serious (yet still squealed brutally). The guitarists seem to work a lot better together and the drumming suits more. They have re-recorded the song ""Eructions Of Carnal Artistry""| which was originally on the ""Christ Denied Split""| and this time it has been perfected. A lot of death metalheads say they would rather crunchy breakdowns are kept out of death metal| but when the breakdown on that song kicks in and that little sweep fill is thrown in on 0:48| I can barely decide what to do between| grinning and gritting my teeth| punching something| breaking something or fuck knows what. Funny| but good shit. I'm not too keen on the blatant Slayer rip off in ""Nailed Through Her Cunt""| but when you hear the great guitar work on ""Sphinctral Enthrallment"" (etc)| it more than makes up for it. Also| nice fucking brutal breakdown on ""Exhuming The Infested"". Definitely a mature but still brutal death metal release. This band seem to just get better."
13,67,Pure Fucking Goremageddon!,0.87,"This was my first Aborted album| I basically checked to see which albums were the best. My eyes clapped on this one and I must be honest: the first week into the album| it didn't click with me. I honestly didn't feel that this was anything special| in fact I was kind of disappointed. I expected my first Aborted album to be great because it received such praise from the fans. I was beginning to think: ""is this what makes a good album?"" The second week into the album I began to get used to it and liked it more and more with each listen. It's my third week now and I'm literally worshiping it.I) First thing's first: the sound. This album makes you really feel like your stomach is getting torn open by a saw. That's basically how the sound is described. Its brutal and powerful and there's definitely a mesh of intense distortion. The vocals are layered perfectly as the guitars play along to a fast rhythm| I would like to say also that the guitars produced melodic| beautiful solos. It doesn't make the album sound like flowers and rainbows| and that's good. With a title like Goremageddon then everything must sound eerie and evil| Aborted executed that beautifully.II) The songs had some nice dialogue filler and that was interesting! It was a perfect move because it pauses the intensity for a few seconds and then resumes afterwards. It makes the song sound suspenseful in many ways and it adds to the intensity mentioned above. Shortly put: this band is like Torsofuck on steroids (and they also don't have morbid porncore themes)| I know I shouldn't even compare Torsofuck with Aborted as they are different| but in terms of intensity and hardcore levels they're similar. The drummer is a total tank because he packs the intensity and power into this album and it blends with the distortion that the guitars had to offer.The brutality is| without a doubt| intense! I can't stress this enough! The vocals are guttural and they fit well with the distorted guitars and drums| this album is a real treat even though you may hate it for the first week or two. The issue with this album is that it's an album that you need to get used to| it's not something that you could like straight away (unless you are familiar with the band's discography). Nevertheless| this album is worth picking up| if you're not into really hardcore death metal...maybe this isn't for you. This album is meant for brutal individuals only."
14,67,Essential Brutality,1.0,"Aborted quickly became one of my favorite death metal bands from first listen. After listening to each release| I can safely say this is their best. This is some of the most genuinely brutal| heavy| crushing death metal ever made.Svencho is an amazing death metal vocalist. His grunts and growls are so unique. There really is no-one who sounds like him. He's also pretty good at the higher vocals. A bit like the higher vocals of Exhumed| but more raspy. Svencho's lyrics are Carcass influenced gore metal| but they're well written with medical terminology| as opposed to amateurish B-movie horror you'd expect from a band like Cannibal Corpse.The guitar tone sounds a bit like a lower tuned version of Left Hand Path by Entombed (who are a big influence on Aborted)| and I love that album's tone| so i love this one just as much. The band also employ some melodic solos from time to time| as can be heard in the (half) title track ""The Saw and Carnage Done"" and closer Nemesis. A brutal death metal band with a guitarist that can play a decent solo is rare| and when they're performed as great as this| it's going to sound fucking sweet. Occasionally the band will play some amazing breakdowns| tastefully placed and well executed. Definitely Suffocation influenced as opposed to metalcore.The bass is mostly inaudible| but the guitars are so fucking loud i'm not surprised. It's mostly likely the bassist is just following the guitars.The drums are fast as fuck. Blast beats are employed in abundance| as well as skillful fills that keep the music going at a decent pace. Variation is not required| as the music is too fast it probably wouldn't work.Samples and audio clips are also common| but unlike most brutal/slam bands| they're well used| short and relevant to the music. In one track| Sea of Cartilage| a sample of an interview is played over a breakdown which would probably be dull if the sample was left out| which is a fine example of how these samples help the music| rather than hinder it.The production is tight| though a possible improvement would be an audible bass. The absolute pinnacle of brutal death metal. Get this album right now.Highlights: The Saw and Carnage Done| Meticulous Invagination| Nemesis"
15,67,Now this is Goregrind at it's finest,0.95,"I gotta say I've always been an avid Aborted fan| and when I heard there latest stuff I was very dissapointed to see there direction there going in now. But I actually went to my local record store and picked this album up and it is somthing else. This is what goregrind should sound like. Not the 10|000 poser bands you can find on myspace| each with there own shitty gimmick and senseless songs. Aborted have brilliant musicianship| Amazing vocals| and most importantly originality.Aborted create heavy as all hell music at blazing fast speeds and tempos. They still incorperate some of there newer stylings on this record| throwing a solo in here or there. But they pull it off| in between the chaos of each track and little melodic moment is here for you to desperatly try to pull to safety untill They come back in and drown you in goregrind destruction. There are many tracks on here that are amazing. Meticulous Invagination| the opening track starts with a devious soundclip ""the doctor is in""| and BAM kicks into psychoticly fast riffing and excellent blast beat drumming as Sven holds this great scream down. Another favorite of mine is ""Medical Deviance""| whch begins with a note that goes up and down the fret board| and continues getting slowly faster. Plenty of hormonics| which any death metal band needs to be to be considered great. I also love the sound clips on this album| some are even inserted 2 minutes in| like on ""Sea of Cartilage"". The intrumentals are second only to the vocals on this album. Sven is such a great vocalist| the best thing is he dosen't have to do anything special really. He dosen't waste his time doing those god damn played out pig squeals| instead he sings in one voice the entire album which is good enough and heavy enough for me. A good mix of highs and lows at the same time here or there as well make for killer vocals. The lyrics on this album are some of the most originall I have ever read. Revolving around medical murders| and the horrors of surgery| finally a new topic instead of necrophelia! A metal first for all brutal bands!All around| Aborted are an extremely tight unit. I was extremely impressed with this entire album| and wish they continued on this path. Sadly they are trying to pull off the melodic death metal thing| which is working so well for them. I hope they return to goregrind where they truly belong."
16,67,Aborted will carve you up!,0.86,‘The Doctor is in….’ – the first four words uttered at the beginning of ‘Goremageddon’. And so begins the bludgeoning punters. I’m not the greatest ‘Gore-metal’ fanatic around| mainly because most of it is rather second rate when you compare it too classic era ‘Carcass’. It takes a good ‘gore’ band to make me sit up and take notice. Fortunately| Belgium’s own ‘Aborted’ have done just that. I first came across ‘Aborted’ back in 2000 via their seconds disc ‘Purity’ released on Goodlife Recordings. Solid| yet entirely unspectacular was my appraisal of their sound. Along with some rather typical| less than appealing artwork I can’t say I was sold on the band.In 2003| ‘Aborted’ are an entirely different proposition. Sure| the cover art work is completely cheesy| over the top shock value for the kids but with a clever little title like ‘Goremageddon’ and it’s sub-title ‘The Saw and the Damage Done’ I not only detected a certain level of black humor within but a very healthy nod in the direction of their main influences| the aforementioned ‘Carcass’. The similarities in titles is interesting – Carcass not only used the title/subtitle word play with ‘Necroticism: Discanting the Insalubrious’ but Aborted even kept the Neil Young theme linked with Carcass| just as they did with their word play on ‘Keep On Rotting in the Free World’. I bet you my gangrenous left limb that it’s entirely intentional!Whatever the deal| it is clear that ‘Aborted’ have upped the ante on ‘Goremageddon’| displaying a brutality and intricate diversity throughout the 11 blood splattered tracks written here. Call it ‘Gore-Metal’| whatever you like| but straight up punters| this is brutal death metal that combines the influences of all of your very favorite genre defining acts – vicious slices of Morbid Angel| Dismember| the mighty Suffocation and Entombed. Oh yeah..don’t forget Carcass - Particularly the ‘Heartwork’ era. The faster| speed oriented riffage laid down here reminds me a lot of the sharp| clinical| clean riff work of Bill Steer and Co. I am also a big wrap for ‘Goremageddon’s’ more melodious moments| especially in the tasteful lead work that breaks up the speed play and adds a rather mature extension to their sound. All this has been enhanced by one of the most stunning death metal productions I’ve heard since Death’s ‘Human’. The man responsible is Jacob Hansen who has previous worked with ‘Illdisposed| Iniquity and ‘Hatesphere’ among others. I| along with many others have held his production qualities in high regard and ‘Goremageddon’ confirms his status as one of Europe’s leading death metal producer. This album is brutally heavy; it has a deep| dark cavernous bottom end and guitar sound to crush skulls. I suspect Jacob’s diary to be rather full after the competition wrap their puss-infested ears around this disc.Lyrically| I believe (because I don’t have them on my copy) that ‘Aborted’ have streamlined their content slightly and moved away from your regular splatter/hack/slash/dice/slice style themes. Good move I say – such lyrics have literally been done to death. Instead ‘Goremageddon’ retains a more controlled ‘medical’ approach while incorporating the serial killer| psychological and religious fanaticism concepts. Good fun indeed.With a video addition for the opening track| the Ted Bundy inspired ‘Meticulous Invagination’ and some tasty medical samples (in typical Necroticism homage) that lead a few of the tracks| ‘Goremageddon’ should appeal to all fans of the brutal Death sound. The best thing to come out of Belgium since…well| since ever! Breakout the Hacksaws punters…Aborted will carve you up!
17,67,yet another gore band,0.87,"now lets get one thing sorted straight from the off.Far from finding overtly gorey lyrics and subject matter ""extreme"" or ""controversial""| I find stuff like this| mainly due to the bands taking themselves way way too seriously and turning into a joke| all rather slightly immature as the vast majority of gore bands end up sounding. That is unless they try to sound like Carcass so much it's obvious to even folk-music fans.Where the likes of Exhumed and Impaled have been content to pass themselves off as virtual Carcass-tribute bands| in comparison| Aborted - whilst they do have some of Carcass' inevitable trademarks - are far more content in occasionally letting their influences show but not letting said influences run the show & inevitably detract from the music.When I first listened to this album| I pretty much approached it from the perspective of an ""extreme metal fan"" as opposed to someone with maybe a slightly sceptical impression (due to the strong gore presence)| and I was actually quite pleasantly surprised.Even if you're more anti-gore or such than I am| there is still more than enough on this small round piece of plastic| and of higher a quality| than any Exhumed or other OTT-serious gore band I've heard so far. Maybe it's due to the slightly-retro feel of the riffage or just the adrenaline that the music instills in the listener| but there's just something about this music that if I was any good with words whatsoever| I'd attempt to describe it's appeal.In my opinion| if there wasn't already Gorerotted out there doing their own (very much tongue-in-cheek) brand of gore| then quite frankly I'd have to install Aborted as mandatory proverbial ""top dogs"" in the genre.Part of the appeal for me I guess is the fact that| unlike a lot of gore/ gore-grind/ death-metal bands that think to combat 'melodic death metal' you have to go to the complete extreme of making your music so amelodic and inaccessible that it just ends up pretty much turning to white noise; this music actually has just enough accessibility to allow you into it's perverse underground lair whilst still retaining more than enough brutality that any self-respecting metalhead could need."
18,67,Saw wielding brutality,0.85,"This album has quite possibly the most appropriate title ever. Well| one of them| at any rate. It's 35 minutes of hacking| slashing nastiness that| despite the band's obvious intention to do nothing but kick people's faces in| never descends to the level of ""ugga mugga blurgh"" stupidity that infests this particular subgenre. Gore metal done correctly can be quite amazing| and Aborted has achieved this with Goremageddon.Beginning with an appropriate sample from Hellraiser 2 - Hellbound| the death machine bursts into action with the rapid-fire blasting of ""Meticulous Invagination""| a loving tribute to everyone's favourite misogynistic psychopath Ted Bundy. Far from being a mindless string of detuned rumbling with tick-tock blasting| the song shifts through numerous forms of brutal violence - there's plenty of juiced up thrash riffs to be found here| as well as a spectacular harmonized solo. ""Parasitic Flesh Resection"" is a two minute kick in the pants| and then the album's quasi-title-track ""The Saw And The Carnage Done"" arrives to inflict major internal damage. This song contains numerous riffs that would have fit on any of Dark Angel's 80's masterpieces| blended with well-placed bursts of blasting. And groove. Yes| groove| in the sense that it makes you want to headbang| not in the sense of moronic hardcore kids attempting death metal. Sven's vocal belches range from a gut-rumbling gurgle to a pained scream| but he never descends into overly low pitched spewing or tormented chipmunk screeches. Did I mention solo's? There's plenty of them here. It's obvious that these guys are very much enraptured by Carcass's use of harmonic lead breaks| and they're quite adept at showing it off. ""Ornaments Of Derision"" in particular features a jaw-dropping series of warbling shred-work in the midst of a frantic death metal attack. The other standout would have to be ""Sanguine Verses (...Of Extirpation)| which is where they drop all semblance of restraint and simply go for the jugular. The slipcase version also includes a cover of Carcass's ""Carnal Forge""| which fits in quite nicely with the rest of the album. It's not a carbon copy either| as they chose to make up their own solo's| which aren't quite as killer as the leads on the original| but are still quite excellent nonetheless. The lyrics| as expected| cover all sorts of disgusting pathological topics| from cannibalism to fecal infestations to serial killers. Even if you generally regard brutal death metal as a ridiculously oversaturated genre devoid of interesting ideas (dog knows I certainly do)| it's awfully refreshing to hear a band like Aborted pick up where the pioneers of this style left off and inject it with some fresh ideas. Highly recommended."
19,68,Who am I when push comes to shove?,0.85,A lot of people see this as Aborted's sellout record| but i'd argue that that didn't come 'til much later (Strychnine)| but even then| that's hardly a sellout record| just a bad one. What this is is basically a very different approach than what Aborted had done before. Yeah parts of it sound a bit metalcore and it's very different to the last 3 albums| but since when did different mean sellout?This is a solid brutal death metal with a fair amount of influence from melodic death metal and metalcore. If that sounds vomit inducing to you| stop reading and go listen to Purity of Perversion. Anyone who doesn't care| carry on.Once again| Svencho outdoes his bandmates with a punishing assault of extremely deep and guttural grunts that put even the most br00t4l of slam vocalists to shame. Accompanying these horrifying growls and a barrage of hardcore shouting. Again| the combination of styles and the way Sven uses them really gives him character as a vocalist| as opposed to just doing the same song for 36 minutes.The riffs range from fast thrashy riffs to mid-paced death metal to occasional breakdowns which I imagine are placed for the purpose of a live setting. While they aren't terribly varied| they are very heavy| and the band have the courtesy not to make them drag on. One such example is opener Dead Wreckoning| which features a breakdown halfway through with some samples from American Psycho (great film with a shit ending) with Svencho seemingly telling a tale from the mind of a madman| about the closest thing this album has to choruses.There are solos on this| but they're few and far between. They're skillfully played| but not very memorable| but still| i'd take a well played throwaway solo over one that I only remember for being bad. Bass nonexistent. No surprise there. Drumwork is what you expect from Aborted by now. Lots of blast beats and concise fills. Nothing terrific| merely competent.This is a solid release from a band that should surely be recognised as a standout from the brutal death metal pack. Worship them like the gods they are. Not their best release| but far from their worst.Highlights: Dead Wreckoning| Gestated Rabidity| The Inertia| Voracious Haemoglobinic Syndrome
20,68,Go go gore core,0.65,"Aborted is the only straight up death metal band out of Belgium that I listen to on any normal basis| starting with the 2nd album Engineering the Dead. The Archaic Abattoir is the band's 4th full length| coming off the heels of what many fans consider their best| Goremageddon. Aborted rock a style that infused grinding Carcass rhythms and brutal drum work with a lot of breakdowns. For this reason (and the way the vocals are positioned over a lot of the chugging riffs)| they cast a few misleading -core shadows on this album and its successors.'Eviscerated carnal delicatesseHad been lying around for daysMy cannibalistic malpractice enthrallsGangrenous process in excessBereaving the swarm of fleshA malpractice in necronutricious form...'But don't panic. The Archaic Abattoir is still hand over fist a death metal record| with energetic bursts of controlled chaos such as ""A Cold Logistic Slaughter""| ""Gestated Rabidity""| and ""The Gangrenous Epitaph"" sure to inflame any pit starved crop of gorefiends. The band does display moments of branching out here| such as the brief electro rhythm that breaks into ""Voracious Haemoglobinic Syndrome""| a track that balances grooves| brutality and some further synth. Closer ""Decend to Extirpation"" does have some dual corish vocals to it| yet the leads and melodies make the song feel bloody and fresh| and it busts out a truly old school feel during the bridge. I'm not fond of all the tracks on the album| for example ""Hecatomb"" is a waste of space| just under three minutes of mostly metalcore breakdowns that occasionally transform into deathgrind with a boring selection of notes. ""The Inertia"" loses just that| it begins with a bang and later descends into some bland riffing before a final| sad guitar rhythm attempts to save it.It's almost as if the album refuses to commit itself fully to awesomeness| playing safe with a few lame pit grooves in a number of the tracks. Granted| it sounds fantastic| with big| chunky guitar rhythms that recall Carcass and no lack for bass or drumming. I prefer Sven's vocals when he's straight up grunting| the use of multiple layered vocals only serves the -core aesthetic| and there is a straight metalcore bark used often. The lyrics are actually decent here| a little deeper than the average sloppy gore. Though it shows moments of worth| The Archaic Abattoir is sadly pale in comparison to the previous two albums. Fans might find enough here to listen on| but my impulses are better served through Engineering the Dead or Goremageddon.Highlights: Gestated Rabidity| The Gangrenous Epitaph| Voraceous Haemoglobinic Syndrome-autothrallhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com"
21,68,I've killed a lot of people...,0.98,"This is a fun album| and because its so good it is in my top 100 albums of alltime and is surely a top 10 record. This is death metal at its finest with tons of brutality and monolithic musicianship. The production on this album is great with excellent clarity of the all the instruments involved. There is an obvious Carcass influence on this record not just with the sick lyrical content but also with the outstanding guitar work presented here. The leads and soloing seems to just come out of nowhere but it actually gives the music an added dimension which propels this album from ordinary death metal to balls to the wall technical and artistic sonic domination. Top tracks include ""Dead Wreckoning""| ""Gestated Rabidity""| ""The Inertia""| and ""Threading On Vermillion Deception"" (my personal favorite).This band has come a long way from their initial releases even though back then they were highly regarded as one of the best bands out on the market even then. They've added more technicality and have enriched their music further since their inception. They have furthered the boundaries when it comes to extreme death metal using heavy riffs and groove oriented combinations transcending a lot of bands while kicking ass and taking names. As a whole this group has advanced to another level with this record and are not afraid to experiment which give them an added versatility to go along with an already brutal sound. With great searing vocals| excellent guitar work| and bone crushing drum work Aborted have given you a glimpse of what is too come for the band. At the end of the day you can call it grindcore or just straight up death metal. It doesnt matter| this shit is sick| gory| and twisted and Aborted have severed the ties to themselves from the rest of crowd.The Archaic Abattoir is a step away from the prior records from this band in the sense that they have added a melodic touch with a almost metalcorish sound. So it may turn off some fans who do not care or have grown tired of the melodeath movement. But those moments are small and in between some truly great death metal.There is just so much to love about this record| its got everything. Its got great musicianship| blood curdling vocals| and downright catchy songs. There are so many great elements throughout this record that there is just no way even the most diehard of death metal fan cannot enjoy. When Aborted first jumped on the scene they have gotten the reputation of being nothing but a Carcass clone| now they have taken what Carcass had started and and further refined the sound and technicality but with advanced it with more heaviness and technique. Even as i write this their follow-up can not hold a candle to this record. This is and was the defining moment for this band and it is a must for any serious death metal fan."
22,68,Something’s Lacking…,0.18,This was the first album I heard by Aborted| and at first I thought it was a strange low for the band that my friends had told me so much about. But then I bought ‘Goremageddon…’ and I realised that it wasn’t particularly bad for them.The problem with Aborted is how distinctly average the song writing is. Also| a small amount of variety would be a nice thing. Throughout the album| there is little or no change in tempo| and the time signature appears to make no change either.The guitar playing is solid| sure| but there’s nothing memorable about the riffs| with the possible exception of one decent riff with quite a bit of groove about half way through ‘Blood Fixing The Bled’. The whole of the rest of the album just melts into nothing worth any hype. Another problem with the guitar playing is the complete lack of technicality. They would appear to get their speed and ‘br00tality’ from the drums. It was once mentioned in a Cannibal Corpse interview that it’s all very well having hyper-fast blasts| but they (CC) get their speed from the guitar playing and the speed of the vocal delivery| which is why their music beats the shit out of this. Final disappointment about the guitar playing is the lack of decent solos. There’s a solo close to the end of ‘Gestated Rabidity’| but that’s just a few notes strung together at quite a slow speed. It’s also woefully short| lasting at around five or six notes. One good guitar solo could add about five percent onto the final rating| but this is another thing which this album is sadly lacking.The vocals are perhaps the most annoying thing on this whole album. Sure| a death metal vocalist is never going to be instantly comprehendible| but unfortunately the vocals for the most part come across like a hoarse monkey whose testicles have suddenly dropped… six or seven feet. Does even the biggest deathcore fanboy want to listen to ‘OOO OOO EEE EEE OOO EEE OOOOO’? I think not. A slight redemption comes with the higher pitched vocals| which are actually listenable.Almost as pathetic as the vocals are the lyrics. As soon as the first lyric (not actually in the lyric sheet| but pretty much the only intelligible thing on the album) hit my ears| my hopes for the album’s lyrics dropped further than they have for any other album. Does ‘FUCKING GO!’ sound like a lyric that’s worth writing to you? Thought not. Continuously through the album| the lyrics alternate between ‘scientific’ junk that probably means nothing anyway| and ‘emo’ shite.The best thing about the album is the drumming. And even that’s only slightly above average| with decent blasts and good other drumming. But as it’s only just above average| there’s nothing more for me to really say about it without sounding like the band’s biggest fan (which I think it’s quite clear I’m not).Finally| there’s the production. It’s alright| but it sounds too much like a modern| clean| no risks production to me. It’s clinically perfect| but that’s not a good thing here.Overall| a surprisingly mediocre album.
23,68,Meh...,0.6,"You may have read one rave review after the next| but if everyone else likes it| does that mean it is good? In the world of extreme metal| we inherently believe this to be false. We like evil| downtuned| obscure| brutal music - and we like it even more because most people can't stand it. That's probably why hate trends build around metal bands that gain too much popularity - if too many listeners have their album| how UNDERGROUND can a band be? While not necessarily an adherent to the hate trend philosophy| I have now become much more wary of over-hyped albums. Such is the case with THE ARCHAIC ABATTOIR.Not to say that Aborted don't have a lot of things going for them. The drumming is fast| the vocals (for the most part) are low and gurgly but discernable| and quite a few cool riffs show their faces over the course of TAA. But overall| this is not a disc you pick up and throw in the CD player - there isn't a lot of cohesion| memorability| or presence there. I can play NIGHTMARES MADE FLESH or BLACK TO THE BLIND any day| and enjoy them just as much as the first time. Not so with TAA. I listen to two or three songs| and that's it.My biggest problems are as follows - blasting drumming just for the sake of blasting drumming| a lot of filler riffs| some obnoxious hardcore vocals| and an overall sterile clean sound. For some bands| this sterile sound works (Decapitated| for example)| but with Aborted everything just sounds overdone.But fear not| there are some cool moments to be found| scattered amidst the clatter. Or splatter| I should say. And before I forget| the artwork certainly is grim - good job| gang. Anyway| ""Threading on Vermillion Deception"" has an excellent main riff that will have most injuring their spinal column. Other than that| there's a cool electronic intro to “Voracious Haemoglob…blab bla bla|” and “A Cold Logistic Slaughter” is pretty brutal. Almost each track has a solo| breakdown| or ingenious drum pattern that will make most fans of this style take notice. And it is interesting how they’ve mixed the medical goregrind genre with melodic death and death-thrash| but that hardcore influence has GOT to go.So| a sixty percent is probably a little inflated| but you can tell they tried and I respect that. One can also see that they tried for a bigger audience| and I suppose you can't knock a band for wanting to be successful. Oh wait| this is extreme metal. I guess you can. Not a mandatory purchase - don't believe the hype."
24,68,Melodic Brutal Death goes Hardcore ?,0.87,"I'm really not a fan of all of this goregrind music| but when it comes to Aborted| I can't complain. This band has stretched the boundaries of it's musical style far enough into the melodic death metal territory| and recently into the metalcore genre.The album kicks in with ""Dead Wreckoning"" which shows| beside a really neat intro taken from ""American Psyhco"" the song shows a wise combination between heavy riffage based upon a drastic groove| and a blasting tempo like what we came to know as the trademark of death metal in general. The vocalist here shows a nasty second side of his throat| beside the familiat gurgling bellow. The vocals range to more Hardcore shouting| resembling a twisted offspring of both Glen Benton and Harley Flanagan. When the song ends| we quickly flow into the more dynamic ""Blood Fixing The Bled"". The guitarwork here reminds me of Carcass| and in conclusion I can say that this feeling followed me while I was listenning to the entire album.""Gestated Rabidity"" is a better song than the last two - not in a speical way| but I guess more well-written. The vocals of the singer shines through this entire record - much more than Aborted's earlier career.If I'll be forced to pick up a highlight| I would point at ""The Gangrenous Epitaph""| which is more groovy than the rest of the songs in the album| and the vocals here are much more hardcore-oriented than the rest of the songs. This song can even mistakenly be considered as a lost Hatebreed tune. Maybe it's diverted theme is what makes it shine in the pile| but I can't really say that the rest of the songs don't do their work.For all of you Carcass lovers from all times| and for those who like to add a little spice of hardcore harshness to an almost dulling formula of brutal death metal - Aborted's ""The Archaic Abattoir"" will be your best pick"
25,68,Brutal,0.85,Despite what the first reviewer has said| this album is killer. Aborted became more than a straight out death metal band on Goremageddon - they became a grind band. No longer did they worry about conventions| boundaries or constraints. They threw grooves in the mix| a few hardcore vocals and - god forbid - some melody. They cared naught what was expected of them.This time around the brutal Belgians have incorporated more of a hardcore/groove orientation. Still brutal as hell| but when you're playing this style of music youve got to keep 'em guessing to stay interesting. Perhaps they wained a little too much from their older work| but this album still tears shit up. Cool samples and structures| stylish grooves| a few melodic passages and as always - brutal death and grind.However this album is not on par with Goremageddon| and I agree that the Haematobic EP had me expecting just that little bit more. Nonetheless| if anyone utters the term 'sellout' or 'commerical' I'll have no choice but to laugh in their face. Bitterly.Brutal as hell| and catchy too. There is nothing wrong with that. If you want a better example of this genre try the new Cephallic Carnage. Awe inspiring.
26,68,Aborted - The Archaic Abattoir,0.33,Yesterday i finally managed to get in my hands Aborted’s newest effort The Archaic Abattoir. The Haematobic EP provided a couple tracks from the forthcoming album and i was delightfully intrigued how the new album would sound like. It sounded a little bit better produced than ”Goremageddon” and that promised something. After i got finished listening to the new album this morning i was utterly dissapointed. Aborted has moved to a more ”groovier” sound on this one? The songs on this album sounds like they don’t know where they’re going| they’re repeating themself. Ok that’s not totally true| you can spot the differences in the guitarsolos. The drumwork is however good as usual and Sven’s roaring vocals are ok but that doesn’t save this album from being a turkey. The hightlights on this albums are Voracious Haemoglobinic Syndrome and Gestated Rabidity which were unfourtunaly already released on the previous ep. The album ends with a confusing feel that your cd player is broken.
27,69,Genre Blending Crusher,0.8,Aborted pissed off a lot of fans with the album prior to this. Their raw deathgrind sound was suddenly much clearer but mixed in with other influences and people don't like change. I prefer this style for Aborted| the earlier stuff is good but too derivative of Carcass (shock!). That being said| Jeff Walker does appear on this album on the most Carcass-sounding song (shock again!).This album has a huge production sound. Everything but the submerged bass sounds massive. Guest drums provided by Dave Haley (Psycroptic)| probably the most in demand guest drummer of recent times. His performance is utterly crushing. There's a subtle use of keyboards on here too which adds a nice amount of depth to certain songs without being overdone. The likely influence of the more brutal end of metalcore is probably what infuriates the purists the most though. I'm not proclaiming this to be a masterpiece| but to my ears this is a strong| vicious album with enough variety to keep my interest.'The Chondrin Enigma' kicks things off with a forboding sample until all hell breaks loose| the drums crash in and it just makes you want to rip someones face off! The only drawback to this album is that every other track isn't quite as good as the last| but just when you think you might lose interest another beast kicks in to reinvigorate you. Not exactly inconsistent but not top notch either. 'Avenious' is a cracking track| probably the most 'mainstream' song on here| as if Aborted could ever be commercially acceptable! Most of these songs have silly long titles (Carcass influence again) so i'll say this: I like tracks 1| 3| 5| 6| 8 and 11 in particular. The Faith No More cover at the end is odd but works....in a peculiar way. Don't buy this if you're a grindcore/deathgrind purist that only wants things done one way. If you're a bit more open minded and enjoy the previous output of Aborted| give this a go.
28,69,Totally overrated,0.53,Well| this isn't how Aborted should sound like. Aborted| once Belgium's most brutal death metal band| sound these days like just another mediocre metalcore/melodic death metal band. Their first releases were right at the top. Pure grindcore| combined with sweet and yes ... catchy death metal. Brutal as hell. The perfect example of this was Goremageddon| an album that blows me off my chair every time. Even the often criticised The Archaic Abattoir| was very good. Even better than Goremageddon in my opinion. Allright| there were a lot of metalcore breakdowns| screams and stuff| but is was brutal and at the same time catchy as hell.Now to this release. Were is the brutality? It seems like it has disappeared. This album is nothing more than a combination between lazy metalcore and very very soft death metal. Every song sounds catchy as hell| but way too catchy. The breakdowns and double bassdrums are totally useless and everything sounds unnatural and fabricated to be commercial. About the riffs I can't say a lot| because I just can't remember any cool riff from the whole album. It's a bit ironic that the last song of the album| a Faith No More cover song| is the most brutal song on the record. But I have to admit that they play the music again very smoothly. The drums are fantastic| as always| the guitar sound is cool and the vocals are again very skilled. But the music as a whole is simply not good enough and certainly not memorable. Only the production and the skilled musicians save this album from being a total disaster. All by all this is a forgettable release and Aborted should urgently think about their future as a death metal band. Allright| metalcore fans will like this very much| but I think they are losing lots of their early period fans when they continue on this road.Musicianship: 18/20Originality: 4/20Songwriting: 5/20Production: 18/20Lyrics: 8/20= 53/100
29,69,The Knee-Bone's Connected to the... something,0.8,The newest album from Aborted continues in the same vein as its predecessor| moving towards a pleasing fusion of melodic death metal and the brutal goregrind of their earlier albums. The resulting concoction reaches its zenith here| heavy enough to satisfy long-time fans and without the frightening brain-hammering that would put off queasier newcomers. This Belgian band’s transition from gore-obsessed noise to something more musically accomplished and traditional follows directly in the bloodied footsteps of the disbanded Liverpool band Carcass over ten years earlier| and the inspiration is fully acknowledged through a guest performance by Carcass’ Jeff Walker on two songs| allowing Aborted complete freedom to rip his band’s sound off almost completely.‘Slaughter and Apparatus: A Methodical Overture’ is more than a simple ‘Heartwork’ clone| though the sonic similarities (right down to some identical sounding riffs) make it a fitting modern-day tribute| depressingly showing just how little progress has been made since that definitive and massively influential 1994 opus. Aborted’s take is naturally heavier| as the band’s departure from a purer strain of brutal death metal hasn’t taken away the edge they possess over the hordes of poor imitators| complete with tediously shocking subject matter. Aborted’s own niche has always been its thematic focus on surgical abominations and malpractice| but this gimmick is noticeably less present here than it was a few years back when each song title competed with the last in the vomit-inducing stakes. There’s an obvious degree of maturity here that finally catches up to the band’s technical skill| and the fresh blood of relentless session drummer David Haley keeps the energy level consistently high throughout its exhausting forty-two minutes| the band’s longest album to date.1. The Chondrin Enigma2. A Methodical Overture3. Avenious4. The Spaying Séance5. And Carnage Basked in its Ebullience6. The Foul Nucleus of Resurrection7. Archetype8. Ingenuity in Genocide9. Odious Emanation10. Prolific Murder Contrivance11. Underneath Rorulent SoilAs a sign of the greater focus on musicianship over cheap shocks and competitive heaviness for heaviness’ sake| gone are the overlong film snippets and voice samples that used to dominate the early parts of songs| restricted to a couple of brief introductory samples at key points. The album builds up anticipation with some nice distortion and American news broadcasts about something or other before the band lets rip. Haley’s drumming is extremely prominent| which can actually become a little irritating in its repetitiveness at times; although he makes excellent use of the bass pedals to provide a spine for the album’s rhythms| his frequent skin assaults (it’s hard to describe this band without slipping into medical terminology) conjure the image of a bloke beating the hell out of some metal bins| which isn’t really to my taste and is a little horrifyingly reminiscent of Metallica’s last album. Nevertheless| the production job is flawless| providing a great depth and volume that’s necessary to get across the full power of the band| and their roots in technical death keep the guitars of Matty Dupont and Seb Purulator (not his real name) a focal point that speeds through multiple interesting and organic changes each minute without spiralling into excessive fret masturbation. Most songs feature some impressive lead sections that bring the Carcass influence to the forefront| and a few feature some highly enjoyable solos in the classic style| as opposed to the squealing discordance practiced by most death metal outfits.Vocalist Sven de Caluwe is one of the more impressive in his field| here alternating between a standard gurgling grunt and a more aggressive yell that comes across sounding a lot like In Flames’ Anders Fridén| especially when the silly electronic distortion is added in track eight. Sven fortunately avoids any kind of metalcore ‘clean’ vocals that would really rob the album of its ferocity and spoil even its less brutal moments| but even the move on from a permanent grunting style ought to annoy some purists. While some songs stick to the older wall-of-sound style fairly rigidly| such as the second track and some of the even stronger pieces towards the end| most are eager to try something new| even if Carcass and Arch Enemy had already been there long before. ‘Avenious’ is the first to venture into truly melodic territory| leaving much of the brutality behind in favour of blending aggression with pleasantly high guitars| and as usual I much prefer these slightly slower| more thought-out pieces to the often mindless brain-crushing riffs of the shorter songs. The album makes excessive and distinctly odd use of fade-outs for around half of the songs| some of which are improved by the drawn-out conclusion| and others of which could just as easily have ground to a halt before getting on with the next. The greater focus on crafting intricate songs also works to keep the album entertaining throughout| only really failing with the very last track which seems to drag on for the last couple of minutes and run out of steam| which makes for a bit of an anticlimax.‘Slaughter and Apparatus’ sees Aborted continuing to claw their way out of the niche they very effectively formed with their cultish early albums| aiming for a wider audience that would greatly enjoy this continuing change of direction for the band. There are enough groove-driven riffs to make it appealing to even the most brain-dead Pantera fan| and it successfully flirts around the spiteful metalcore trend without selling its soul. Hopefully| angry kids will start listening to this sort of music instead| allowing those fallen melodic death bands to come back from the dark side| and making everyone a lot happier. As expected| it’s near impossible to discern what Sven is growling about in these eleven songs| only really becoming intelligible when he yells| but whatever the hell he’s angry about| it’s impossible not to concur with him wholeheartedly.
30,69,Aborted - Slaughter & Apparatus: A Methodical Over,0.89,The new Aborted had been announced as the kick ass killer release of 2007| and many people including me didn't actually know what to expect. Since 'Goremageddon: The Saw and the Carnage Done' in 2003 I have always been expecting a follow up to that one| and The Archaic Abattoir in 2005 was something of a big change in the music of the band. As 'Goremageddon' was an ultra brutal version of Carcass' 'Heartwork' (and hell yeah| I love that release as much as 'Heartwork' itself)| so was 'The Archaic Abattoir' a new approach from Sven De Caluwe and Co. They simply went with the time| and it seems they evolved their style from just hammering and battering to musicianship that would make most Brutal Death Metal bands jealous.And now most bands should be jealous as aborted released 'Slaughter & Apparatus: A Methodical Overture'. The title is almost as long as the 2003 release'| and the concept is almost the same - murder| pathology| surgery and sickness in general. But the music has new elements| new ways of being a way to destroy your senses and ears. Aborted attack now from a totally different angle. They now use melodies more frequent and still combine them with a massive wall of sound. It's as if you were banging your head against a thick wall of concrete and your head was left just a mass of pulp and blood. Some of the solos remind me of 'Goremageddon'| but it's almost as if a new core was formed in the band. It may be mostly to the replacing of the bassist and drummer. Psycroptic's David Haley did the drums for this effort| and he did a hellova job. His drum work this time was a real surprise to me| as I expected him to just do the same he does in Psycroptic| but he has done his job as if he was a full member of Aborted. Sadly| this was just session work| and Aborted are still looking for a full time drummer. The best way to describe 'Slaughter & Apparatus: A Methodical Overture' is as a hybrid of 'Goremageddon' and 'The Archaic Abattoir'| but a better 'Abbatoir' this time| and a more melodic 'Goremageddon'. This now is also the longest effort of aborted to date. The 43 minutes of play show that the band spent much time in generating great arrangements and creating the best possible music since the forming in 1995. While some folks enjoy more the brutal period of this band| 'The Purity of Perversion' and 'Engineering the Dead'| it's no secret that this band gained a huge following with their now more melodic and Carcass-like Death Metal. And now they will gain fame with this release. Aborted succeed to impress| and you should be highly impressed.
31,69,Good-time brutality,0.8,When I bought this I was being told by everyone that it was second rate beside Goremageddon. I have barely heard that album| so I guess you could say I went in with a clear head.Slaughter & Apparatus is brutal| plain and simple. It delivers exactly what I want from Aborted. The catchy grind grooves sound very refreshing to me in a scene full of technical-for-technicality’s-sake death-core bands.The production here is heavy as hell. I’ve read a few reviews that saw Tue Madsen did a too “clinical” job. The guitars may be a little on the modern side| meaning that they’ve sacrificed mid range and crunch for low end heft. The drums are also a little low| most likely due to the fact that (I believe) the drummer on this was a temporary hired gun. But all in all| the mood set by this sound is dark and disturbing| and it matches Aborted and this album quite well.The only real bone I have to pick with Aborted on this one is the lyrical delivery: they often write lines that don’t quite fit with their vocal parts| so they either squash or cut off the words. It’s annoying for that one time you actually read along| but after that it’s really no big issue. There are actually some catchy lines in there| and contrary to a lot of people| I really like the shouted vocals that counterpoint the guttural ones.I wouldn’t recommend this if you only have money for one album| because in the end it isn’t that memorable| but it’s damn heavy and it’s damn fun. To listen to while playing video games| working out| or performing surgery.
32,69,Still Going Strong!,0.9,"Belgium's finest death metal band| Aborted| have released yet another excellent album. ""Slaughter and Apparatus"" is the fifth album they have put out so far| and it shows that the band is still improving their sound. They may not be the deathgrind that they used to be when they kicked off their career| but even with a change of sound overtime| they prove themselves to be strong and dedicated. This band displays some of the finest musicman ship on this album. First off| the drumming is excellent| even if the drummer isn't a part of the band. Psycroptic drummer David Haley goes behind the kit and just blasts like crazy| but not on complete overdose. Also| Sven's vocal range is what makes this band so special. Whether it's a low-pitch guttural style| or his higher pitched shouting vocals| you can't deny that this man is a genius when it comes to vocalists. The guitar melodies are still excellent as ever| and they still mix in the melodeath style with the crushing deathgrind riffs in the vein of Carcass. Oh| and speaking of Carcass| Jeff Walker makes an appearance on the track ""Odious Emanation""| so those that miss Carcass can know that Walker still does his thing excellent. If you are looking for an album with crushing riffs| loads of melody| excellent vocal range| and some of the finest drumming| ""Slaughter and Apparatus"" is the album for you."
33,70,A brilliant release,0.95,"Another album in Aborted discography can safely be called ""the masterpiece"". It is simply great| without a doubt. Brilliant recording| which is hard to find on the scene. Albums recorded with such passion and flair you want to listen always and everywhere ...On the ""Strychnine.213"" Aborted showed us a lot of courage. The courage to do something new. Apparently| there are plenty things in common with their previous works| but at the same time there are many new elements| which were hard to expect. There's a difference between recording once again similar sounding album and taking up the challenge| and entering new| so far unexplored territories. I do not claim Aborted copied themselves on their previous albums| but the fact is - even though the systematic improvement of their style - their albums were more or less predictable. With ""Strychnine.213"" it is quite different.The opening intro (""Carrion"") announces something new. It is well known that an explosion of brutal sounds will occur in a moment| but in the background echoes something unusual - a melody. It is still brutal| we still have to deal with typical Aborted tracks filled with a lot of technique| but this time the melody| not aggression| is the main point of music - the eye of the storm| which is trying to overwhelm the furious attacks.You can blame Aborted for getting a bit relented on this album| you can. But your complaint will be groundless| as musically it is still brutal and powerful| though accompanied by a melody. So what? If you don't like it| you can switch to ultra brutal releases from Unmatched Brutality or Bones Brigade. ""Strychnine.213"" had to sound like that. That album wasn't recorded ""by accident""| everything in here is carefully planned and recorded with special care and absolute perfection.You don't write about brilliant albums| you simply listen to them. That's why I will drown in this ""sea of pleasure"" for the x-th time. I must add - for ""Pestiferous Subterfuge"" Belgians deserve every musical award. With this track they moved the border of genius into areas unreachable for a common mortal. Well| gentlemen - keep up the great work! I want it more!!!(This review| written by me| was originally published in Metal Mundus webzine in Polish language - now translated into English)."
34,70,Depressing,0.05,At the point before hearing this album| I thought Aborted were untouchable. A band that could do no wrong. The 3 albums that preceded this were perfect| as was the EP that followed it. But this shall forever be a black mark on Aborted's legacy for me.This album feels sloppy| boring and seemingly like no effort went into it. Like the band made this album because they had to and didn't take it seriously. Everything on it sounds rushed or not rushed enough. Svencho sounds tired and like he's not giving it his all in the vocal department. The riffs are lazy death metal chuggers. The drums are perhaps the only thing played decently| but they're still terrible in comparison to other efforts.If i'm wrong| and Aborted did indeed try on this album| then i'm very disappointed. If they were trying| they were pandering to the new deathcore crowd rather than their old school brutal death-head fans. This record probably has the most breakdowns out of any Aborted record| and sadly| they aren't the varied technical breakdowns of before. These are lazy chugfests that wouldn't be out of place in a Suffokate song.Really| this is either Aborted not giving a fuck about the album or this Aborted trying to make some money with a bit of commercial appeal. Avoid this unless you consider yourself a fan. Maybe you'll get some enjoyment out of it unlike myself| but I highly doubt it.
35,70,WHA HAPPENED!?,0.3,I'm one of the few who actually supported Aborted's move to a more mainstream| melodic| metalcore-influenced sound with 'The Archaic Abattoir'. While many considered it selling out| I thought the band finally hit their stride with that album| blending extreme and mainstream styles of death metal in a wonderfully catchy and infectious way. That being said| there's literally nothing I can do to justify 'Strychnine.213'. This is possibly Aborted's worst album to date| managing to have a thousand musical ideas that never go anywhere| haphazard| aimless songwriting| and incredible amounts of repetition throughout the album's (thankfully short) running time. I don't know what the hell happened here| but Aborted have badly fallen off track with this release.Aborted's sense of riffcraft and songwriting has been pretty industrialized at this point in their career: a blend of slightly more melodic than usual death/grind tremolo against fairly oldschool| slow death metal riffs and periodic forays into metalcore breakdowns or US-style melodeath riffing. The combination makes for a really varied and engaging texture. On 'Strychnine.213'| however| it seems the band decided to just throw all those elements in a pot together and stir until it became an indistinguishable mess. The tracks seem predominantly midpaced| but not particularly heavy or sludgy- they're just filled with go-nowhere riffs which feature a completely bizarre hint of Zakk Wylde-style southern rock. Not to say they do any better when they speed things up; the tremolo riffs tend to be rather randomly arranged| and the almost omnipresent cock-rock soloing is hideously overwrought and does nothing but detach the listener ever more from the album. Sven's vocals sound tired| haggard| and phoned-in| and despite the blast beats and low guitar tuning| the band just sounds incredibly unenthusiastic about what they're playing. Given the quality of the material| I can understand it.Another problem is that the flow of the album seems to get broken constantly| be it by the same bland Charles Manson sample we've all heard a thousand times before| an inappropriate clean guitar interlude| or just one of the hundred obnoxious solos that dot the disc like flies on a rotting orange. The music has no real sense of motion or drive behind it- when a song ends| you're not really in a different place from where it began| and it's honestly very difficult to tell when a track changes unless you're paying a great deal of attention. The album just seems to go by in a blur and the band doesn't seem very concerned with making each (or any) of the tracks unique and interesting. It's just almost forty minutes of the band playing what amounts to the same song over and over again| excising all the things that made Aborted a great band before and replacing it with pure filler.This is a pretty dire record and I'm hoping this was just a fluke. Aborted have proven themselves to be a strong band in the past| so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that this is their one big mistake that I can give a pass to. Still| that doesn't make this album any better| and you definitely shouldn't pick it up if you demand anything from your music at all. Basically worthless.
36,70,I'm afraid I misunderstand?,0.95,"Perhaps I am missing something| but don't entirely understand why Strychnine.213 gets so much shit from the metal community. I love it| as a matter-of-fact| its my second favorite Aborted album to date. Now before the shit starts to fly| my first favorite Aborted album is Goremageddon: The Saw & Carnage Done| a choice which many Aborted fans would agree with. But why do I enjoy Strychnine so much? Because its something new.I enjoy the senseless brutality and mind-boggling speed of this kind of music just as much as anyone else| but this is Aborted's 6th studio album| and who wants to hear the same recycled formula over and over again? The presence of melody on this album| in my mind| is Aborted's way of staying relevant. Let's not pretend here| brutal death metal is a fairly limited genre. And when you've lasted as long as Aborted has lasted| members changes and all| you're going to run out of ideas eventually. If you don't like the new sound of Aborted| that's your preference| but don't bash them. They're just exploring new territory. If you were in the band| you'd probably not want to play the same chug-chug riffs over and over again| album after album. Hell| they lost a guitar player over that very issue!The new direction isn't a sign of their sound being dulled down; they still remain extremely brutal. They've simply combined they're brutality with something new. Take ""I35"" for example. It retains the blistering speed from past albums| but they also added more melodic guitar leads| and it makes the song more interesting| without butchering the flow of it. In my opinion| what Aborted fans SHOULD be saying| instead of ""wow| they sure have lost they're touch""| is ""wow| they've really found a way to be creative!""To this long-time fan of all things brutal| the sound of Strychnine.213 was a risk that Aborted took after over 10 years of creating some of the most devastatingly brutal music in the death/grind genre| and I think its a risk they should be rewarded for."
37,70,Something's missing.,0.45,Strychnine.213 is probably the weakest album of Aborted’s discography. Released less than two years after their last effort| the rushed nature seems to show through. Whether this was the fault of the band themselves or their record company wanting them to release something else quickly is still a mystery. At any rate| this is what has been produced and it’s not as good.I’ve liked all of their releases to some degree| for different reasons. While this album is still Aborted| it doesn’t give us a reason to come back| and not listen to their other albums. I mean| think of it: The goregrind of The Purity Of Perversion? Gone. The brutality and speed of Goremageddon? Gone. The catchy groove of The Archaic Abattoir? Gone. This is a very substandard concoction of seemingly throwaway riffs and melodic leads (way more melodic than any other release…the beginning of “A Murmur In Decrepit Wits” for example)| all wrapped in a production too clean for it’s own good. I have no problem with clean production| but this particular production| with the music itself| seems to have no lasting power. There are barely any riffs or sections of the music that you will want to remember because they are all so…well| I hesitate to use the word “bad”| because they’re not bad at all. “Mediocre” is more like it.Still| this album can still be enjoyed somewhat. It’s still undoubtedly Aborted| and some fans will be able to see some good in it. “The Chyme Congeries” is not such a bad song| and keeps my interest throughout. Perhaps what makes this song more enjoyable than most of the others on this album is the fact that there are NO melodic leads anywhere. When Aborted go back to just writing brutal songs| I feel it works better for them. I mean| the follow-up| “A Murmur In Decrepit Wits”| is much| much more melodic| and not surprisingly| it’s not as good.Funny enough| the most brutal song on here has to be the Pantera cover of “Slaughtered”. While I’m not familiar with the original| Aborted’s version sounds very heavy| and all the songs on here should’ve been as intense as that.The band members are still as competent here as they have been at any other release. I don’t see any reason to bash their playing abilities| because they can all still accomplish their respective roles in the band. I could even go as far as to say they’re getting better as time goes on| but that doesn’t mean they play better riffs| of course.Weighing up the good and bad points of this album| there are many more bad points than good| and as such| this album will be classed as Aborted’s worst. I can see how it’s good enough for others| but for me| there is just something missing in the music| and it’s much too noticeable. If you’ve never heard Aborted| this is definitely not where you should begin. Here’s hoping they can do a little better on their next album.
38,70,It works for me.,0.8,"Aborted has gone through many a change throughout their careers. They started off as a very brutal five-piece. Then they experimented and went through many trials and tribulations. They eventually started moving over to a more melodic side of death metal. Now fast forward to today. Almost completely gone is the brutal aspect of this Belgian outfit and in comes melody and some hints of technicality. I guess you can call it a melodic technical death metal outfit for the time being.The guitars on this album do their job. Sure you have the chugs and the breakdowns| but does that really constitute them becoming a deathcore band? Absolutely not. The guitars provide intricate melody and good technical parts where fitting. The riffs put forth on this album are very different from what we're used to from Aborted| but it still works. The guitar solos also never fail to intrigue from this band| as expected. They have moved on from the straightforward one-dimensionality of brutal death metal and decided to create a more relaxed| for lack of a better word| atmosphere and a greater depth to their riffs. It would seem that Aborted's guitarists wanted to push the experimental nature of the band to a completely new level| and succeeded in doing so.The drummer does a good job in making the album stay interesting. He changes up just in time to keep the listener in suspense and wondering what's next. The drums fills in this album are well done| but my problem is that they are recycled into other songs. I found myself saying| ""Hey| didn't I hear that a song or two ago?""| quite a few times. Luckily| the drums were not at the forefront of the album| constantly suffocated by the vocals and guitars| so the drums did not pose a big problem for me.Sven never fails in his vocal duties to this band. He has a pretty good range of vocals on this album| from a gurgling scream| to a high pitched shriek| not unlike a black metal vocalist. He has really gained a good range over the years. His addition to this band is truly priceless| as he is a unique vocalist. Without him| there would never be Aborted. His ability to speed up his vocals and then slow them down is impressive as well.In conclusion| this record is a good addition to the already great discography of Aborted. They have pushed the bounds of experimentation and put out a good melodic/technical death metal album. Going in a completely different direction than previous albums| they may have alienated some fans on this album because of the lack of brutal overtones. But what those fans fail to realize is that Aborted has matured. They decided to not stick to the same old formula. While it's not their best album| it is a very solid album. I would recommend it to anyone ho is willing to listen to something new| and to Aborted fans who are willing to shed all past judgements of them and prepare for something completely new."
39,70,Brutal enough for SINCERE listener!,0.9,I don’t think that anyone serious about music could say that Aborted once were good band| and nowadays they are just trendy or whatever. But many people “into Death Metal” say that kind of stuff. You know what? You have to be crazy| or totally uninterested| or a true hater to say something stupid like that.Aborted once presented one of the most brutal bands on the scene. So what? Now they are brutal and interesting| creative| original| exciting band. And that is happening from “Goremageddon...” till today. Last year they released something really wild| that insane “Slaughter...” album| and a year and something after they bring us logical continuation with “Strychnine.213”. And I can tell you; this is one hell of an album. “Strychnine.213” sounds really| really good – maybe not “brutal” enough| maybe not by-recipe enough| maybe not progressive or whatever enough| but be sure that you will hear some very decent Death Metal| unpretentiously speaking. Just listen.Haters| you should be realistic about Aborted – it’s not the same band anymore| physically. Singer Sven is original member; other guys are here from year 2005/06/07| so line-up is relatively fresh| like the sound. On the other hand| it’s not the same band musically| so don’t criticize them from a “goredeathgrind-is-only-good-music” point of view. That is very infantile.Anyway| what we got here is Brutal/Groovy/MeloDeath/Death’n’Roll album; perfect and insane riffing| raging perfectly played drums| and| off course| very aggressive and guttural vocals| with time-to-time screams; but I would say| it’s DEATH METAL| no more or less. Rarely nice created and played. I wouldn’t even bother mentioning one or two best songs| it’s simply good DM madness. Nearly perfect.
40,70,Cobbled-Up Carcass,0.4,I’m surprised something like this doesn’t happen more often - a certain band member leaves| and the rest of the band is unable to recapture the essential sound. That’s exactly what happened to Aborted| which basically turns “Strychnine.213” into cobbled-up bits of death metal| melodic death metal and death rock| except none of the pieces flow together| they’re just stuck together like bits of uninspired generic tedium.Sure it’s an attempt to basically pull Carcass together from their gore/grind| melodic death metal and death rock eras all together on one album| but “Heartwork” has proven to be one of the hardest melodic death metal bands to rip off| meaning anything related to melodic death metal on “Strychnine.213” comes through like the 4th recycling of harmonies from Sweden.Everything is trodden down in a muddy morass of low-end production| loose drumming| snares comes close to clicks| and Sven de Caluwe’s slurred low growls. His vocals could be a high point| as he has a wonderful deep growl| accented by piercing screams| all he needs to do is pronounce the lyrics (yes| that’s an important skill| even in death metal!)The end result is like throwing several puzzles together| forcing the pieces together| then giving up and using white school glue.Originally posted at www.waytooloud.com
41,71,Warning: destroys worlds,0.89,Aborted is certainly my favorite grind-related death metal band by far| and this album is a perfect example why they are the kings of their workplace. Every album of theirs is just so fun and exciting to listen to| no matter what kind of mood you're in| it just makes your blood pressure rise; you cannot listen to this without moving yourself in some sort of way| guaranteed. The guitars are perfectly tuned and go through a medley of sound changes throughout| from extremely high harmonic parts| to destructive| earth-shaking lows. There are several solos all over the album and none sound reminiscent of another; they all are creatively built and are never shoehorned where they shouldn't be. The drums are ridiculously fast| and certainly set the pace for the other members. The blasts and double strokes are out of this world fast| and sonically sound huge| with no complaints sound-wise. One thing that makes the drum work so great on this| is that Ken can do the fast stuff| but never plays fast when it's not needed. That's one of my biggest gripes with drummers is that they show off whenever they can and ruin the mood and tempo of the songs| needless to say he keeps himself under control. The bass is very audible and one of my favorite things about the album are the bass drops. Bass drops are hit or miss because most bands overuse them to the point of irrelevance| but these are not speaker destroying drops| just something to spice up the brew of seasoned organs. Now to get to one of my bigger gripes of the album: the vocals. The lower style vocals are seemingly layered into oblivion and kind of get on my nerves after a minute or two of just them| but Sven's high to mid range vocals came back to save the day. I would certainly not mind if the entire album were just Sven's unedited vocals| but that's just me. The song structures are all over the place in terms of variety. Every speed of song you can imagine is on this album| from mind bendingly fast to slower| drowsy| dissonant distortions and this is how every song on this is so special and different. No instrument overpowers another| which is almost unheard of in any genre| and all of them sync up into one hulking mass of destruction. This is strange to say but this album is very cinematic and epic for what genre it is: there are numerous sound clips of various lengths and subject matter strewn throughout| and they add a boatload of value and depth to the song structure. Most of the songs are relatively short but what Aborted does better than almost anyone| is make their songs sound longer with just how much content is being put forth; there are so many timing changes and interludes that 3 minute songs sound 5 minutes long in contrast. Perhaps my favorite part of the album is how sincerely smooth each song changes from one another. It is done in such a way where you can tell it is a new song| due to tempo and some tuning| but there is literally no awkward void of silence between tracks| and I think all bands should adopt this philosophy. The album ends with an epic| 6:30 minute song that is a perfect closer to the vanilla album| and then the bonus track kicks in| which is basically someone icing the proverbial cake at 200mph. Overall| this album just freaking rules. Everything about it is awesome and I can make a bold statement that everyone who likes or loves death metal will enjoy this unconditionally. Go buy if if you haven't already| the bonus track is almost worth the price of entry alone.Favorite tracks: The Origin of Disease| Vermicular| Obscene| Obese| Grime and the title track.
42,71,Ferocious and melodically devastating,0.94,Belgian brutal gore/grinders Aborted have returned after a surprisingly decent album to offer up a new album that not only returns focus back to the extreme side of their patented sound| but does so with a severity and intent to maim that makes this one of their very best works overall.The extremity is heard almost immediately as the rapid fire beating undertaken on the first proper two songs| the title track and the outright vicious ‘Origin of Disease’| showcase a band that is back to undertaking its malicious aims through a combination of razorwire-riffing and infectious intrusions of melody| as the two songs display a remarkable ability to maintain a vicious edge| yet keep the material memorable and well-written. Other blasts of brutality are apparent in scorchers ‘Coronary Reconstruction’ and ‘Grime’| which features a duet with Jason Netherton of Misery Index that might rank as the most intense track the band as a whole has ever recorded. Other stand-out tracks include the rather catchy ‘From a Tepid Whiff’ that features one of the better written lead sections on the album to the outright memorable ‘Of Scabs and Boils’| perhaps as hard-hitting and punishing as any other track with its frantic blasts of grind whirling around at ultra-velocity that makes for a totally damaging section on the whole album.Beyond the brutality| what makes the album work as a whole is the seamless meshing between the insanity and expertly-controlled chaos of their earlier works with the infusion of melodic passages that were introduced more recently. ‘Vermicular| Obscene| Obese’ is the most accomplished of these types of tracks on the album| effortlessly switching from murderous mayhem to almost harmonic riffs with a bit of groove thrown into the mix that is delectable and highly memorable. Also of note is ‘Expurgation Euphoria’| which begins with an eerie piano intro that soon gives way to a simply memorable riff that showcases the band’s ability as songwriters and performers that have come a long| long way from the very beginning.All of this is fine and well if you’re into this brutal genre of music| though to some this may sound like a cacophony of noise and inhuman grunting over the top of it. That’s far from the truth| but that impression can be given off since this does tend to run into each other when it gets to the back half of the album| and the obsession with surgeries-gone-wrong can get old pretty quickly. It’s more than just a bunch of noise| though| and those that give this one a chance will find it to be plenty worthwhile and more than adequate death metal album.
43,71,Refreshing & Punishing.,1.0,"The mid 90's. A period which spawned forth an overwhelming amount of death metal/grindcore bands for the world to indulge upon. Somewhere in the frenzied mix| Aborted sprouted from the grounds of Belgium like a zombified| bloodied| disfigured| beautiful corpse. As far to chaos that music waves can reach| Aborted have been a primitive group to extreme music. Though slipping a tad off the positive radar with the release of Strychnine.213 in 2008| Aborted have recollected the weapons they kill best with. Resharpened| resuscitated| and ready to begin a slaughtering spree| the creation of Global Flatline may very well be the best extreme release of 2012. Something incredible must be in those Belgian waffles. Unlike previous albums Aborted have put out| they now combine a strange and efficiently creepy use of ambient noises. ""Omega Mortis"" softly pours in| and instantly a pummeling thud crushes all hope of sanity. The post-apocalyptic feel to the intro literally poisons you. A pulse monitor carries the brief period of silence into the guillotine. This is 43:30 minutes of pure warfare. Most recognizable| is that every track is respectively different than the next. This isn't some hyped up death metal album that sounds all the same through out. Aborted have cast the die and won the most treasurous prize out there - ORIGINALITY. Their coined melodic solos make a return and shine| if not blind| excellently out of the 13 tracks (especially ""Endstille"" & ""Fecal Forgery""). There is just something about Sven's vocals that provide such intensity & furiosity to your day. He's grotesquely raw| vile and unique. The patterns of vocals exquisitely invite other such talents as Jason Netherton (Misery Index)| and Keijo Niinimaa (Rotten Sound). It all matches the instruments so bloody well. Forget straight forward psychotics| this album is also coated with groove. Tracks like ""Of Scabs and Boils"" (using much different guitar riffing patterns of previous Aborted works) and ""Grime"" (pulling hardcorish riffs| meshed into a pure grindy holocaust). The songwriting is absolutely brilliant and there is no doubt in my mind that a riff or two will be stuck in your head for weeks. Last but not least - Ken Bedene. Where the hell did they find this guy? He literally tears into his drum set like a ravenous lion gorging on a torn open zebra. It's psychotic| precise| and mind blowing. Drum fills & speeds that clench one big mighty fist to fuck the planet with. As the final track| ""Endstille""| begins| it leaves you with one ugly feeling. You either get goosebumps from the haunting radio clips & dissonant riffing| or you want to blanket yourself with razors and embrace the end. The ending notes & world famous speech by J. Robert Oppenheimer lets you go as if you were overlooking a destroyed city from a mountaintop. Smoldering rubble and clouds of black smoke. Which is just what this album does - FUCKING DESTROY. Let it spin and enjoy the best release metal has to offer for the year of 2012."
44,71,As I Dissect and Reform,0.85,Aborted have long been a project close to my heart. Though I was aware of| and interested in| these sick Belgian death metal surgeons through a number of years and releases| it was 2007’s divisive Slaughter and Apparatus: A Methodical Overture that cemented them as genre favorites. Cries of dissent rose from the faithful at the inclusion of melodic| almost Gothenberg-style elements| but for my twisted| black little heart it was just tits| being a huge fan of both straight death and melodeath at the time. However| like so many others| the puzzling follow-up Strychnine.213 sent a number of warning flags flying in my brain| as the band had seemingly dumbed down their relentless assault a bit too far| skirting the border of a nightmarish land of agony and blood-stained compositional fecal mounds that metalheads fear to tread| a realm of disease that can unwittingly spread to even the most pure of projects. I speak| of course| of the subgenre entitled deathcore. To be fair| the album wasn’t bad| but the implications were a bit frightening. As it turns out| we need not have worried.4 years and a complete band change later (excepting vocalist and band leader Sven de Caluwe)| a practice that has become too commonplace is the world of Aborted| we have received the cure to what ails you| in case Strychnine had given you the disheartening deathcore sniffles. Indeed| it’s genuinely pleasing to report that Aborted have returned to those stomping grounds of yesteryear| having stitched together a wonderfully diverse monstrosity with Global Flatline. Alongside the new Cryptopsy| it does my heart good to welcome back not one| but two legendary death metal bands back into the folds of good taste (though Aborted only stepped into crap-town for a smoke and a chat| while Cryptopsy up and moved shop).Under first impressions| it felt like the band had gone back to the purely intense| unstoppable chainsaw grindhouse they inhabited up through Goremageddon| but shovel deeper into this inviting grave and it becomes clear that Aborted have logically attempted to unite their various influences under the banner of brutality. The songs are much more structured than your average cut from the early years| and are a bit easier to listen to and comprehend| without feeling in any way like a cop out. There is more than enough hurried blasting| but the songs are well constructed| flowing nicely between the obligatory merciless bludgeoning and a predilection toward ingrained melody circa Slaughter and Apparatus| and even a bevy of choppy| rhythmic infatuations from Strychnine| though they are surrounded by a lot more window dressing in the form of strong riffing and truly inventive solo’s. There is an impressive array of songs on display here| each with an identity of its own| thanks to an even parsing out of strong riffing ideas and the ceaselessly inventive drumming of Ken Bedene. Global Flatline starts ripping up corpses right out of the gate with unchained hacking and chopping. The Origin of Disease needles along with psychotic precision into a melodic| alien midsection. Shorter tracks like Fecal Forgery and Of Scabs and Boils are rhythmic clinics and skewering riffing vortexes| while Expurgation Euphoria and Endstille paint epic scenes of apocalyptic| gore-ravaged earth. Every track has something different on offer| and all impress equally| without a loser in the bunch.A number of guest vocalists pepper the production| including Julien from Benighted| Jason from Misery Index| and Trevor from Black Dahlia Murder| a personal favorite| though I wish he’d had a bigger part to play than the small consideration in Vermicular| Obscene| Obese| just one of the happy ditties featured on Global Flatline. As one would no doubt expect| the lyrics are as sick as ever| continuing to take cues from the Carcass school of medical death metal in concocting lyrical dissertations on situations of extreme medical conditions| stories exploding like pustular pockets of rancid feces and other appetizing conditions. Ready the white coats| as a glance at fun song titles such as Fecal Forgery and From a Tepid Whiff will make the sphincter quiver in anticipation.I did have a slight issue with the production. The instruments are all quite balanced and audible| but as usual within metal| the bass could have used a boost in volume. Besides that predictable aspect| however| I feel that Sven’s vocals| particularly his throaty| incomprehensible growls| sound very unnatural here. There is some kind of obscuring studio effect that really steals the raw savagery from the man| and it’s an issue that remains prevalent throughout| a constant irritation. Also| like most frantic death metal| it will take a number of spins in order to truly appreciate| and it continues to grow on me; always a good sign.So| aside from a couple minor annoyances| I’d have to say that Global Flatline is exactly what Aborted needed at this stage of their career| a balanced| well-produced| modern bludgeoning that both strengthens and freshens up their established sound. Slaughter and Apparatus has been my favorite Aborted album since its release| and it still edges this one out| but I have a sneaking suspicion that this could change| given time. My enjoyment of it is about equal to Archaic Abbatoir and Goremageddon at the moment| but I find I like it more all the time| so it could very well surpass those albums| a real feat. I can’t believe I’m typing that| but that’s the present truth of it. Time will tell| though. Time always tells. It’s certainly their best sounding record by a mile. Truly| I can’t think of who wouldn’t enjoy this one| unless you just dislike death metal altogether. If you’re a prior fan| and don’t think Aborted have been doing enough rampant killing of late| this will probably satiate your blood thirst. It’s the same story if you’ve been with the band this whole time| like me| and as it’s such a balanced mix of their established elements| it’s also a sweet place to start for any new worshippers. Don’t you love it when everybody wins?-Left Hand of Doghttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/
45,71,Beautiful,0.85,"Aborted's ""Global Flatline""| a release that looks promising to say the least. I can say for the most part that this has topped their previous work| everything on this instalment is clear| organized and neat. Putting that aside| it also packs a brutal punch with some nice grooves and licks that are sure to knock the socks off any death metal alike. It's what you'd expect from any Aborted album| dialogue fillers and then the brutal riffs and drum beats| the shitting on religion and singing about nasty surgeries and nailing some chick through the cunt with pure steel. This is a real treat to Aborted fans| new and old.Aside from the typical Aborted we all know and love and what to immediately expect on this album| there has been a lot of changes. For one| everything sounds so clean and clear and organized| there's never a moment where you feel something is off beat or cluttered| instead you feel like you're getting a solid death metal quality. It's nothing like ""Goremageddon"" where you feel like everything is being played through a plastic tube| instead it's as if the band had received an awesome upgrade| modern and yet awesome.Everything has totally improved and Aborted| as a band| have gone a long way and look at them now! Powerful| perfect band chemistry and unity| killer tracks and they can make a hell of a good album. The only issue I have with this is that it's somewhat predictable| you know what the band is going to sing about| nothing more an nothing less. You know what the lyrical content will be and you know exactly what's going to go down. I'm just asking for a little bit of originality here| then again it proves they're sticking to their roots. Other than that| the Belgian boys know how to please their fans and stay true to their roots. Buy this if you wan't to break your neck."
46,71,The soundtrack to the end of the world| part I,0.8,"Ladies and gentlemen| those crazy Belgians Aborted proudly present the soundtrack to the end of the world. Aborted's sixth full-length to date is without a doubt their most impressive as far as my now bleeding ears are concerned. The first thing that struck me about Global Flatline is just how bad-ass it is| Aborted are really going for the throat this time around| bludgeoning anyone who cares to listen to death with a furious| mechanical drum battery| littered with stupendous lead guitar work| face numbing bass| devastating riffs and vicious vocals. Take the best parts of early to mid-period Carcass| add a spot of slower Morbid Angel à la ""God of Emptiness"" and a virulent injection of Hour of Penance/Fleshgod Apocalypse plus a spot of Benighted| and you have the mayhem Aborted have crafted for us all to hear on Global Flatline. The album kicks off after a short intro with the title track| an assault of light speed double kicking dispersed with heavily palm-muted guitar stabs laying the groundwork for the devastation to ensue and once it explodes the band don't really let up. We have furious odes to madness such as ""Fecal Forgery""| and slower paced killers like ""Expurgation Euphoria"" which splat your face like an anvil launched from a cannon. The band utilize their melodic tendencies as well in the album closer ""Endstille"" with some frighteningly well done guitar leads and harmonies| making for an incredible end to the album. As a bonus for those who bought the special edition you will find to newly recorded versions of ""Nailed through Her Cunt"" and ""Eructations of Carnal Artistry"" to end the proceedings| which for my money are superior versions. Overall| Global Flatline is an utterly devastating release| and I was really surprised by the quality. The only slight downsides are that the vocals can be ropey in places| maybe a little too modern| however the quality of the music hammers this downside into nigh on nothingness. As with Primal Fear setting the standard bar for power metal| Aborted have thrown down the gauntlet for extreme/death metal. A jolly good slaughtering| recommended!Originally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com"
47,71,By far the best material they have done in 8 years,0.85,The year of 2003 was of great importance to me. It was the year that I first discovered Aborted through their legendary album “Goremageddon: The Saw And The Carnage Is Done“. “Goremageddon” was a showcase of how a group of lunatics who listened to far too much Carcass could effortlessly blend together relentless and uncompromising brutal death metal with catchy melodic leads and hooks together to create a sound that very few people were prepared for| and one we have not heard since then. That album helped put Aborted on the map and became a must-have album in the world of death metal as a whole. The music was so razor sharp| bombastic| violent| and guttural that it remains my fourth favorite album of all-time. While their subsequent releases of “The Haematobic EP” and “The Archaic Abattoir” were pretty good in their own right| they couldn’t hold a candle to what “Goremageddon” had achieved. Since then| Aborted has been plagued by unstable line-ups| which I blame for giving us sub-par albums like “Slaughter & Apparatus: A Methodical Overture” and “Strychnine.213“. With Sven de Caluwé (vocals; System Divide) being the only original member left in the band I can imagine it being very difficult to find a working musical formula when a line-up can barely be kept for over a year. However| when I read things from the band exclaiming that their new record| “Global Flatline|” was more of a “return to form” to their old days of brutal death metal| a glimmer of hope formed in me. Could this be the bounce-back that I have always dreamed for Aborted?“I’m gonna fucking rape your soul!“ Hell yes. That is exactly how I want to be greeted when listening to a band such as Aborted. Come at me full speed with scalpels akimbo| hacking and slashing at my ear drums. After a short introductory track you are immediately bombarded with that sample| Sven’s dominating growl| furious riffing and plenty of blastbeats in the title-track| “Global Flatline”. It is a very promising start to how Aborted may very well have gotten their edge and aggression back. While their thirteen frantic homicidal tales are weaved through gore-laden imagery and more brutal death metal one could shake a stick at| the melody that I loved about this band remains intact| and is in no way forced into sections it does not belong. While this album may not stand up to “Goremageddon” levels of adventurous riffing| it has many moments of its own that makes you appreciate “Global Flatline“.Aborted have crafted a very well-done combination of brutality with the main passages with melodic leads being thrown on top of toe-tapping rhythms| and would normally segue into a stylish solo. Normally formulas like this would grate on my nerves after a while| but I found that every song had its own unique way of keeping the familiar progressions nice and fresh for the listener. I’ve listened to this album several times now| and there aren’t any portions of the music that I find to be hackneyed or stale. They have really turned their style into a wonderful hybrid of brutal melodic death metal| and I have a feeling this album can actually gain quite a few new fans if they like tracks such as “The Origin Of Disease|” “From A Tepid Whiff|” and “Of Scabs And Boils”. Even though the melody is quite prevalent in this album| fans of their older brutal style need not be disappointed| as this album has many moments that are reminiscent of “The Archaic Abattoir” with a much more modern death metal take on it. One element of this album I found quite enjoyable were the slams thrown into the music for good measure. They are used pretty sparingly and are never the main focus of the music. They come at points where it fits in very well with the atmosphere and enhances the music greatly. I am also sure the last track| “Endstille|” will surprise quite a few listeners with its soothing melody and apocalyptic atmosphere. If you buy the Limited Edition of this album when it is released| you will be treated to two re-recorded bonus tracks: “Nailed Through Her Cunt” and “Eructations Of Carnal Artistry” from their legendary opus “Engineering The Dead.”The production values of “Global Flatline” are top-notch and mixed beautifully. Really| I don’t know how I can put it any better. All of the riffs are crushing| the leads and solos are crisp and razor sharp| the bass guitar is audible and has a nice crunch to it| Sven’s vocals and multiple vocal layering are very powerful| and Ken Beden’s drumming is superb. My only issue with the production is very minor| but sometimes the faster and lower-note staccato riffs can get buried underneath the bass drums and Sven’s vocals. I think that was something that could not be avoided as this album is very bass-heavy| and if you combine that with the modern guitar tone then there are bound to be some clashes here and there. There is also one part of the mixing that I am not happy with| but I’ll explain more below so as not to spoil anything.Now| I want to spend some time talking about Sven de Caluwé’s vocals. I always found him to have one of the best voices in death metal as it is completely recognizable| making his guttural spewage to be a huge trademark of the Aborted sound. While he may have legendary status in my eyes| the last two albums he did made him sound utterly uninspired and flat. Not only was it a chore to slog through the droll and generic death metal on those records| but Sven’s vocals sounding the way they did just really turned me off from the band. I know it sounds harsh| but that is how I felt after seeing one of my favorite bands release two boring albums in a row. But| I don’t know what the hell happened to him in between “Strychnine.213” and “Global Flatline|” but whatever it was| keep doing it. Sven sounds more alive on this album than he has in nearly seven years. His deep guttural growls sound absolutely visceral and filth-ridden. His screams are as tormented as a vulvectomy with no anesthesia. This is Sven de Caluwé at his very best| and he is who you get on “Global Flatline“.Speaking of vocals| once it was told that there would be guest spots by vocalists like Trevor Strnad (The Black Dahlia Murder)| Jason Netherton (Misery Index)| Julien Trechan (Benighted)| and Keijo Niinimaa (Rotten Sound) I was very intrigued to say the least. After not being supplied with any information on which tracks they appear on| I had to listen through the album several times to try and make them out| and I was able to determine which track each of the four appeared on| and goes as such: Jason Netherton (“Grime”)| Keijo Niinimaa (“Our Father| Who Art Of Feces”)| Trevor Strnad (“Vermicular| Obscene| Obese”)| and Julien Trechan (“The Origin Of Disease”). The three of them certainly made their time with Aborted very useful since they did great on their respective tracks. Although I do wish that Keijo could have done more than just be a part of the chorus. Julien’s gutturals and Trevor’s screams are both delivered in very similar manners when compared to Sven’s| so when they are mixed the same way it was very difficult to tell them apart. I wish the engineer would have tried to make Julien and Trevor stand out more on their tracks| because if you hadn’t known they were supposed to be on the album| you never would have noticed in the first place.It has been almost nine years since “Goremageddon: The Saw And The Carnage Is Done” was originally released. It will always be the definitive Aborted album in my mind| and while “Global Flatline” has done a lot to redeem the band from their previous blunders| it is not on par with “Goremageddon“. The reason for that is because that era of Aborted is dead and buried| never to return. Until “Global Flatline” was thrusted upon my ears| I always hoped that we would get another “Goremageddon|” but now I’m glad that the band has moved on. They’ve moved on to bloodier pastures and found a new mixture of guttural brutality with unrelenting and moving melody that grabbed me with its sharp meathooks that wouldn’t let me go. The only real hiccup was Trevor Strnad and Julien Trechan being very difficult to identify| but despite that mixing error| my standards for this record are very high| that is pretty damn good. My needs were met greatly and I even gained a new perspective on Aborted| and they are back with a vengeance.Originally written for Metal Blast (http://www.metalblast.net/)
48,71,Great Effort| Still Lacks,0.75,"For a while we saw Aborted tipping on the firm line between death metal and deathcore. Their roots heavily lad-ed in Brutal Death Metal| not many were welcoming the change. Aborted's 2008 release| Strychnine.213| saw scorn and appall from fans and review sites alike with very few embracing the metalcore/deathcore-esque style unleashed| leaving us to ponder if this was the new direction the Belgium band decided to stick to. Well| let me just say that whichever side you took... you were right. The intro track to this album does it's job. It sets the atmosphere for the rest of the album| incorporating haunting synths and an audio clip that mimics a news broadcast| spreading tale of the horrific outbreak of disease. And then you're shoved into the midst of the fall of humanity.The title track of this album is an adrenaline pumping| bone chilling explosion of chaos. The track starts off slow| with deep| low driving guitar riffs and base lines before erupting into unholy pandemonium at the declaration of ""I'm going to fucking rape your soul!!!"". Gripping and unrelenting| the crushing bass can take your breath away.Tracks 1-5 are heavy with unholy bass drops which clash thunderously with the frantic guitars| tracks ""The Origin of Decay"" and ""Coronary Reconstruction"" standing out amongst the five. However| these are also the tracks that see the most disappointing solos of the album as they sound cut-off| and most of them use the same scale and take on a more Melodic Death tone.Frenzied| yet melodious and solid| the material is accompanied by a mix of Sven de Caluwé's long missed gutterals and the new| cleaner Deathcore style. The two tones play well off of each other| sometimes giving the sense of two singers from how layered the tracks become. Incorporating various audio clip tie-ins has always been a trait of Aborted| and that remains standard on this material as well.Concerning the rest of the tracks| 6-13| the weakest tracks are present. ""Of Scabs and Boils"" and ""Vermicular| Obscene| Obese"" have the most Deathcore-esque presence in comparison to the rest of the material presented. Both tracks are upbeat and the heavy bass is absent| along with the use of pinch harmonics and gutterals. The overall tone of these two songs drastically changes from the album's start| and detract from the brutality.""Expurgation Euphoria"" and ""Endstille"" are radically different from the rest of what is presented on Global Flatline. ""Expurgation Euphoria"" being a slow track| given both an intro and outro comprised of memorable piano melodies which sandwiches in unfathomable depth both lyrically and musically.While ""Endstille"" is made the perfect end track to the album itself. Fading in| all that is heard is a static ridden radio broadcast| followed by a few minutes worth of instrument work only until the best solo of the entire album finally hits. Atmospheric| serious and heavy| the track ends appropriately with a heart rate monitor beeping| and then eventually flatlining.The rest of the songs presented on this release are standard from what one expects from Aborted| and overall this album is leaning into Brutal Deathcore| a sub-genre that has not very well ventured yet. Including both old and new styles| and even breakdowns| if polished and fine tuned a bit more this could be an improved style for Aborted. Hopefully one of which oldschool fans and new fans alike can share some common ground."
49,71,The Gore Fathers Can Still Forge,0.9,"About fucking time. Aborted has dabble in melodic experiments for far too long (not that they were bad| Strychine.213 was pretty good) and has finally went back to their splanchnic roots of goregrind. Goregrind is an oversaturated genre nowadays| with all these back-alley bands that think that a bunch of 900 BPM blast beats| mindless detuned grooves| and horrible guest vocals by frogs| dogs| and bulls make a goregrind band good. It's like an abortion with a kick in the stomach compared to a suction-aspiration one. Well| the master-butcher has returned| and he definitely showed these superfluous dilettantes how to wear the bloody apron and use the power-tools without disemboweling themselves like fucking idiots. This album is a welcome relief; feels like the goregrind of the old pantheon| tinged with obvious modern (in a good way) influences. This album is great because it completely revitalized the genre| and can easily bring together the veteran metalheads with the younger generation| without causing them to kill each other in order to prove which one's the scenester. It takes the medical-malignancy theme| low-pitched vocals| and firm velocities| chops them up| cooks (or keeps them raw| if you will)| and serves it in a dish of blood-drenched human bones and skin. The album also features solid guest vocals from Rotten Sound| The Black Dahlia Murder| Misery Index| and Benighted| all bands I love. Even though The Black Dahlia Murder's Trevor doesn't really fit in the ""grindcore"" setting| he still executes his role like a freshly manufactured scalpel| yet to cut the skin. The album starts with some apocalyptic news| a dying heart monitor| and basically impending doom. And that shit delivers. The album feels like being chased by a horde of ravenous flesh-eating zombies| or getting a premature autopsy| whatever floats your boat. Superb songwriting combined with neckbreaking speed with actual song structure is an obvious choice of a soundtrack to a zombie apocalypse.Aborted definitely delivers in skin-cracking lashing| without killing your ass| but making sure you're going to suffer until the end. Lo and behold| high and low pitches| fast and slow playing| guitar and bass solos. Creepy 80s B-Movie horror-like guitar harmonies and just a general atmosphere of blood| gore| viscera| and everything pathologically erroneous make this album awesome. Relish this goregrind masterpiece; there's enough entrails and guts for everyone to sink their hungry blades and teeth (or... other stuff| if that's your thing) into."
50,71,Not ready for coroner's report yet,0.9,"It is not easy creating a good deathgrind album. You need to execute compositions at finger-blistering speeds while always maintaining a strong songwriting structure. Breakdowns and solos get squeesed to a virtual non-existence and if your riffs don't hold up to your speed| all you will end up with is a mediocre fast-paced death release. You have to think back to Fear of Napalm| third track from Terrorizer's stellar debut as a standard for generations to come: instantly groovy| brutal and fast.When Aborted hit me over the head with this riffcraft carrier of an album I needed a long lie down to recuperate. Every track was memorable| different and above everything else - catchy. Guitars' level of distortion is perfect for this genre| they are sticking to you like gooey rotting zombie flesh in the inferno of nuclear apocalypse. Drums storm you with a wall of assault rifles precision. It's the SWAT team| cleansing the aftermath of the apocalypse. On occasional tracks you will even get a grenade explosion effect - I swear| a couple more listens and I will only be able to play this record pressed against a wall in the corner of a room with a rifle in my lap| oggling the window and the door expecting a pack of flesh-hungry zombies to break in at any moment.Aborted do something rare for metal scene here - they have guest vocalists from bands Benighted| The Black Dahlia Murder| Rotten Sound and Misery Index on four tracks. I know this from the internet| because honestly| I never would have spotted them myself| despite the fact that I love and regularly rock out to all of these bands. You could blame my inept hearing| but a big part of the reason here is that Aborted's own frontman Sven de Caluwe has an impressive range and goes from ripping screams to low-pitch growls in a blink of an eye. To the extent that the whole album feels like it is performed by two vocalists and when the next guest growler does appear on a track my mind simply goes ""well that is just another of Svencho's pitches"".While their immediate partners in crime Misery Index keep a steady foot in reality with occupy wall street and kill all thieves approach| Aborted stick to the tried and true gore aesthetics. It is no joke that one of the catchiest songs on Global Flatline is called Fecal Forgery immediately followed by Of Scabs and Boils. With the cover art| intro track and occasional gorey quote inserts you won't have to go a long way to imagine this as a sort of a concept album with the main themes being putrefaction| malignant ooze and global eredicating decay. The world as we know it is flatlining on us! Quick grab the pedals! Thank god we have Aborted to shock it back into life."
51,71,Finally| some action!,0.8,Aborted are back| two years after releasing the very successful Coronary Reconstruction EP. Global Flatline sees the band going back at their older style and it makes up for a brutal beginning of 2012.If there are scenes which are oversaturated with a myriad of bands playing the same style| and featuring more followers than leaders| then that would be the brutal death metal scene. Aborted never had a huge reputation in the metal world and the fact that they put out some weaker efforts has made their career a bit inconsistent; with past works proving to be more efficient than their recent streak of murdering affairs. In Global Flatline they make no compromise and instead opt for a return to the style that has made them famous| a mix of old school death metal with brutal unrelenting passages| a bit of technical flair and even a few melodies. So the turn for a more interesting style made in their previous EP is here expanded into full-length territory. If you’ve been reading my description of their newest album then you might be asking yourself why I associate Aborted with the brutal death scene| and in fact sometimes this album isn’t leaning towards it| but in the end the favoured backbone of their music tends to be that specific scene. They pick on that formula and constantly improve it by adding different elements| which will make them be considered “only” death metal to some| while even gracing our ears with some calmer and more melodic sections where we can get some rest in the neck area.But the simple fact is that this band has a lust for gore and a pleasure for hurting their listeners| just look at the zombified populace on the cover art of the album and you’ll understand what I mean. Then hit play and after a small one-minute intro the title track will completely demolish your brain! The beginning of the song is your typical brutal death beating with heavy double bass use just before it explodes in hefty snare hits and blast beats galore. The song’s main riff is quite infectious and to the point| making you bang your head from the start and accompany the hectic tempo changes on the drum department. The solo near the two minute mark is a nice touch and introduces a catchy chorus with dual vocals| falling then into a great breakdown before it melts your face for another half a minute. No time to breathe as the next track| “The Origin Of Disease” keeps the pace on overdrive and the drums in machine gun mode. Again the typical brutal death breakdown is effectively used and the only annoying factor is that strange snare sound| something I can’t sadly avert when listening to this track. Again a small guitar lead is present and the complete array of variations in the drums make me think of somewhere in between the Italians Hour Of Penance and the French Benighted| at least on their last album.Comparisons to Benighted aren’t that much of a stretch since Sven has lent a hand (or a throat) in past year’s Asylum Cave| and now Julian makes the reverse path by returning the favour here. Other guest vocalists include Trevor Strnad| Jason Netherton and Keijo Niinima| which everything considered are some of the most brutal singers in extreme metal nowadays and their presence only adds more fury to the mayhem already present on this record. The album continues to level the ground with a sheer degree of intensity for the next few songs| with “Fecal Forgery” being the moment where you can actually catch some breath as it falls down into more mid-tempo territory with a nice grooving mid section before it blasts away again. The following| “Of Scabs And Boils”| is a slightly different tune with a more melodic main riff and dare I say some Heartwork era Carcass influence to be found beneath the barrage of double bass. There’s also a slight hardcore influence here| not falling into slam territory though| and the song ends up being rather melodic in the midst of the remaining tracks. This is also where the comparisons to Benighted hit a new high| but still Global Flatline evades the more grindcore and slam based execution of the Frenchmen. If you thought this small piece to be uncanny then “Vermicular| Obscene| Obese” brings back the fury in full force with another hellish attack on the senses| nevertheless being able to retain a good sense of groove. By this point in time the album is only halfway through and you find yourself already gasping for air. The remaining tracks are more of the same that’s been described above with some attention being owed to “Expurgation Euphoria” and the closer “Endstille” for being slow churning burners that still manage to take a heavy toll on you; or “The Kallinger Theory” and “Grime” for their interesting melodic leanings on the guitars.This album finds itself in borderline territory between your typical death and brutal death metal band| a place where it can fall leniently to both sides with much ease by choosing to be more melodic and less frenzy on one hand| and totally slamming and unrelenting on the other. So this in between approach turns Aborted into an extremely appealing meal for both crowds| and more so catches the band with a renewed will to release quality music. This is a strong offer from a band that’s been as inconsistent as inconsequent in the past years and it might again grab the attention of many fans that had given up on them| as well as fall in the radar of a new legion of willing listeners. Global Flatline isn’t here to reinvent the wheel but it’s damn fun and even catchy| and I don’t mean that in a Six Feet Under way if you catch my drift. The album is very consistent throughout its thirteen tracks and manages to keep your attention for its duration| clocking just below 45 minutes. So if you feel the need for a speeding rush of adrenaline or just a little bit of ambient music to set the tone while torturing your next victim in your well hidden dungeon of gore| try this one out. It’s bound to become your best friend for a few weeks even if you’re not the typical brutal death metal lover. It’s a nice day for a killing| so spin this one… loud!Originally written for and posted at Riff Magazine
52,71,It rapes your fucking soul,0.9,"A triumphant return for Aborted. After the less than stellar Strychnine.213| Aborted got their shit together and released the Coronary Reconstruction| a true return to form. Finally| in the year 2012| Aborted bring out Global Flatline| their first full-length for four years. I've been anticipating this album since it was announced. Is it good? Yes! Was it worth the wait? Definitely!The album begins with a nice intro| made up of some creepy piano music and some sound clips from a news show warning the public about nuclear war. After this intro| it begins. A slow chuggy riff| with a blast beat| then suddenly| ""I'M GONNA FUCKING RAPE YOUR SOUL!"" and the band proceed to do just that. The riffs are heavier than they've been since Goremageddon. The drumwork consists of mainly blast beats and technical fills. Standard Aborted drumwork| really| not that's a bad thing. The solos are getting more epic as time progresses. Some of Aborted's best solos are on this release. Global Flatline may contain their best solo ever. The bass provides a nice tone under the layers of brutality| but you really have to look out for it.Perhaps most triumphantly| Svencho is back on the top of his game| following a very lackluster performance on Strychnine. He finally sounds as angry and brutal as he did in the late 90's again. Guest vocals also appear from an all-star cast of extreme metal frontmen. Julien Truchan (Benighted on Origin of Disease)| Jason Netherton (Misery Index on Grime) and Trevor Strnad (The Black Dahlia Murder on Vermicular| Obscene| Obese). I'm also told Keijo from Rotten Sound is on this| but I can't remember hearing him.The band have also made their longest song to date| in the near 6 and a half minute closer Endstille. Most of this track has a dark atmosphere to it| with Svencho bringing his signature vocals about halfway through| before the song fades back into the atmospheric darkness.Overall| a brilliant return to form from a brilliant band. It's a bit early to say| but this could easily be Album of the Year 2012.Highlights: Global Flatline| The Origin of Disease| Of Scabs and Boils| Grime"
53,71,A Great Return!,0.95,"Aborted has got to be one of my favorite death metal bands ever. They are heavy and brutal while also coming up with interesting hooks and riffs to keep you into the music. Not to mention Sven is one kick ass vocalist. I wasn't entirely disappointed with the release of Strychnine.213 but that album was definitely no Goremageddon. It seemed like most of the songs on Strychnine lacked drive and power. Well that's definitely not the case at all with Global Flatline. I can safely say Global Flatline will be one of the major death metal releases of 2012. So on with the review! Global Flatline starts off with an eerie into track entitled ""Omega Mortis."" This track sets the stage for a the brutal pounding you are about to receive with the next track| which happens to be the title track. The intro to the title track is very reminiscent of a Suffocation-esque slam section. This is by no means a bad thing at all. The song then begins to pick up the pace and an audio clip bursts in saying ""I'm going to fucking rape your soul!"" Then begins the aural assault that is Global Flatline. Everything is great on this album from the vocals to the instrumentation. The guitars have vastly improved from their previous album. There are more intricate riffs and more well written solos. The drums are pounding and really give a great feel to the music. They are fast when they need to be and groovy when appropriate. The song writing on this album is just outstanding. The vocals are amazing as usual and the bassist does his job very very well driving the music forward with heavy undertones. The lyrics are your standard gore filled| misanthropic lyrics that you would come to expect from Aborted. All in all this album is a must have album for any lover of extreme forms of metal. It's brutal| punishing| and has a catch factor that surprised me very much. I'll find myself humming some of the riffs from this album or saying some of the vocal patterns to myself. Stand out tracks: ""Источник Болезни (The Origin Of Disease)""| ""Coronary Reconstruction"" (Also found on their previous EP)| and ""Vermicular| Obscene| Obese"" (This song has guest vocals by Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murder!)"
54,72,The Hindu god of necromorphs.,0.73,"In recent years Aborted has become something of an elite purveyor of a well-rounded modern answer to the death metal question| one that is cognizant of the recent phenomenons of slam| deathcore| tech. death and brutal death while not quite jumping on any or all of those bandwagons completely. It's a paradoxical sense of nuance within a style of metal that eschews the very concept of nuance| and indeed| the resulting sound they display does not come off as anything short of sheer impact| but compared to other bands their sound is a bit more well-rounded and shaped into a fairly digestible smorgasbord of mangled corpse pieces. This story holds truest for their 2014 LP The Necrotic Manifesto| which has a highly theatrical take on their craft| featuring a hodgepodge of classic horror flick samples from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 to the Hellraiser saga functioning as segues between some technically tinged brutality to rival the last couple Pathology albums.All eight gloves and off from the very beginning as the ensuing cacophony of deep chugging riffs| frenzied tremolo runs| blasting machine gun mayhem and vile shouts takes its cues from the same place where Dying Fetus and Benighted go for their respective lessons in mass grave filling. After a sampled orchestral ditty and a few words from Pinhead| ""The Extirpation Agenda"" fires with both tubes| blurring the lines between the outer fringes of extreme death metal and the hyper-dissonant modern grindcore sound right from its very onset| and yet somehow making time to settle into occasional galloping grooves. A comparable musical story is told on the title song ""The Necrotic Manifesto""| blasting away at light speed but soon settling into a thrashing groove riff that provides an almost catchy counterbalance to all the unfettered rage. Varying degrees of sheer brutality to almost slamming groove bridges round out most of the album in a very methodical fashion| with the key focal points being the guitar solo sections| which are both technically masterful yet tasteful and a needed consonant contrast to all the systemic chaos.Truth be told| despite the guitars occasionally injecting a degree of atmospheric contrast here and there| the place where this album manages to show its greatest degree of textural depth is the vocal interplay. Sven's assortment of shouts| barks| grunts and occasional gurgles have a strong degree of hardcore influence on them| particularly when resorted to a more intelligible| mid-ranged shout. This is most present during the points where things hit breakdown territory| especially on ""Your Entitlement Means Nothing""| but the sound of multiple vocal tracks crashing against each other makes occasions for this approach on just about every song. The only outright deviation from the formula is on the closing number ""Cenobites"" where a processed spoken narration makes a few appearances| all but perfectly imitating the stoic and dismissive tone of otherworldly conceit that typifies the speech of the characters in question.In similar fashion to the last Abominable Putridity offering| Pathology's Lords of Rephaim and Throne Of Reign and recent Dying Fetus| this is an affair in highly processed and compressed brutality. Consequently the sound comes off as a bit mechanical at times| something that is further enhanced by many of these songs following a fairly strict formula that keeps them sounding heavily similar. As an album it's a consistent listen| if not an outright overwhelming experience| with much of the arrangement behind the vocals and lead guitars being fairly uniform and inorganic in feel. It's the sort of album that really hits the listener like a ton of bricks at first strike| but kind of tapers off after repeated plays. It's the sort of album that solidifies one's base| but doesn't quite hit the mark for universal appeal that tends to go with a new classic."
55,72,Best Album of 2014,0.95,"I first became a fan of Aborted upon the release of Global Flatline| and after discovering that I delved into their discography and fell in love| and eagerly awaited the release of this record. It did not disappointFirst of all| the artwork is phenomenal. Here we see a crazy re-imagining of the infamous surgeon from ""Goremaggedon"" by Par Olofsson| which is every bit as gory| over the top and fun as the music itself. Aborted incorporate more of a grind sound on this album than they did on their last| with plenty of blast beats| furious riffing and inhuman vocals. However this does not mean that they have stepped away from the slightly more melodic sound that was incorporated in Global Flatline. Instead| this album combines all of the brutality and speed of Aborted's earlier work as well as the catchy melodic passages of Global Flatline and produces a beast. Misanthropy| gore and perversion are the key lyrical elements here| which are standard Aborted themes. Sven's vocal delivery is as varied and crushing as always| ranging from guttural bellows to raspy shouts. Ken Bedene's drumming is phenomenal| the blast beats and double kicks on this album are insane| but not overpowering. He knows to slow down once in a while to stay refreshing and not become boring| as demonstrated on the gloomy DIe Verzweiflung. The guitar tone is thick and clean| and quite honestly perfect for this style of music. It allows the two Guitarists to show f their technical abilities without sounding too clean and polished| and also allows for a crunchy sound in the devastating breakdowns in songs such as Cenobites and Coffin Upon Coffin. The use of samples from horror movies throughout the album is also very fitting and adds even more of a deranged atmosphere to this gory masterpiece of an albumTo describe this album is one word: crushing. It is catchy and brutal as hell| and well worth a listen."
56,72,Another solid effort from Aborted| but nothing new,0.63,"This is one of the few albums I was really looking forward to this year. Ever since ""Engineering the Dead""| Aborted had claimed me as a die hard fan. On each album| they deliver punishing| brutal technical death metal| and this album is no exception. But is that a good or a bad thing? Let's talk about that.I'll start by talking about the production and overall sound quality. On this album they had Jacob Hansen behind the boards| who had previously worked with Heaven Shall Burn and Volbeat among other artists. He did a fantastic job with this album. The fat guitars and thick drums blend exceptionally well with each other| while the bass guitar is essentially inaudible. I have this issue with almost every extreme metal album| so it could just be me; but with my ears the bass guitar is nonexistent. On a musical level| well| it's not your average Aborted album. When you put on an Aborted album you know you are going to get awesome| complex heavy riffs with brutal vocals. That's what technical death metal is. However| I had a problem with this album because of that. Aborted took a different approach to this album| giving it a lot more of a deathgrind sound. That means that there are a lot| and I do mean a lot| of blast beats and double bass. Almost all of the drumming is blast beats going as fast as the speed of sound. Now sometimes this is a good thing| but Aborted decided to use these drum techniques in every single song. It makes them all sound the same. A lot of the time it's difficult to distinguish which song is which| making this album tedious to listen to as a whole. Each song on it's own? Fantastic. However I'm not the kind of guy who likes to put their ipod on ""shuffle"" and see what songs randomly play. I enjoy listening to albums start to finish| and it's hard to do with ""The Necrotic Manifesto"". Aborted used to have a recognizable groove that forced you to bang your head| and unfortunately this album lacks that. Hopefully next time| we'll get that back. Overall| I give ""The Necrotic Manifesto"" a 63% because it definitely isn't a bad album| it's just very repetitive."
57,72,A fine if slightly flawed manifesto,0.85,The eighth full-length album from Belgian goremongers Aborted| “The Necrotic Manifesto|” is certainly serviceable enough for what it sets out at being| but just lacks the finer elements within that made their previous release as much fun as it was.Apparently following along nicely from their previous work| which adequately mixed their brutal grinding philosophy with a technical bent and melodic chops| all of which were parts of their sound in different parts of their career| this new seems to follow suit in that tone rather well. The unconscionably brutal riff-work is still in fine form here with a direct leaning to its early days with nods to both grindcore’s scattershot manner of tight| unbridled violence and barely controlled fury with the brutality inherent from a series of sweeping dive-bomb patterns and incessant chugging that are both part of the bands’ signature sound. When it’s all mixed together with the jagged| razor-sharp riffing and pounding rhythm section| the result is a rather frank and brutal assault of traditional rhythms and incessant violence that only this band can deliver and gives this the album’s most familiar moments. As well| there’s a rather direct and noticeable attempt at injecting some frantic and chaotic patterns that really makes the band a stand-out in terms of their brutality at hand getting an even bigger push with the inclusion of so many wild| uncontrollable rhythms thrown into the mix that makes for a wild and exceedingly excessive effort. Still| as the band had begun with on their last album| the melody that was thrown into their brutal stance on the last album is continued here and it really makes for a rather enjoyable ploy to have the two polarizing forces at work within the same album. It adds a lighter atmosphere to the dripping-wet rhythms and makes the sections listenable instead of being so over-the-top bludgeoning that it’s impossible to really enjoy them. So| all told| this one ends up with tight| intense riffing with sweeping dive-bombing patterns| incessant chugging and unbridled violence against touches of melody and sporadic lighter moments for a truly well-rounded and yet entirely cohesive experience. This is due to the remaining elements at play here| with the dexterous| devastating drumming doing all it can to demolish and dismantle the senses with the chaos and speed it plows through these tracks alongside the buzzing bass-lines and severely guttural vocals that provide a lot of extra emphasis on many of these tracks. The drums hit incredibly hard and generate plenty of hard-hitting| devastating patterns that roll through the tracks with blinding| near inhuman speed that recalls full-on drum-machines at times but displays far more sense of melody and timing than such a machine could ever match. The bass is usually really busy in the rhythms making for a rather complex and highly technical display with a series of spindly fills| heavy buzzing chugs and general thumping refrains that add extra meat to the heavy-handed bone that the rest of the band plays with. The vocals| as usual| are manic| intense and highly-varied| ranging from inhuman gurgle-growls to clear mid-register bellowing and hoarse shrieks that further add to a sloppy| wet atmosphere that has been the band’s forte since the beginning with yet another stellar performance here.As far as the album itself goes| there’s one rather irritating feature throughout which does tend to harm this one overall. The fact that there’s far too much sampled effects| dialog and scores from movies and TV shows in here that they eventually become distracting instead of beneficial to the experience as a whole. This is something rarely attempted by the band for it wasn’t done a lot in their previous albums| but there’s a right way and wrong way to add samples into the music. The right way to go about this is how it was accomplished on the intro| for not only is that the perfect way to introduce audiences to your material by giving them a sense of familiar trappings to ingrate them on what’s to come next| the band manages to choose a wholly appropriate line of dialog to further prepare listeners for what’s to come in the album ahead and therefore scores exceptionally well in terms of what it’s trying to accomplish. The rest of the album is a clear example of what not to do with samples| which is to spread them liberally throughout the album without any real rhyme or reason. The inconsistent nature of choosing them to be either track intros or outros is done without any discernible pattern leading to a wildly-varied attempt even before overlooking the fact that the majority of the samples chosen have no real bearing on the track at hand. That just leaves them with the feeling that the band chose them for what they’re saying| which does have a series of sinister intentions throughout if that’s to be believed but the scattershot approach and wildly-varied themes that don’t tie into what the track’s all about ultimately leave this tactic feeling like an after-thought when it really shouldn’t. Beyond that| the only real issue here is the fact that there’s just way too many tracks on a release like this. It stops being overkill around the tenth track or so| but for a brutal band like this to release an effort with over a dozen tracks is just tired to the point of getting numb to the bludgeoning in the later half with yet another continued assault like the previous ten or so you’ve been exposed to| and then there’s another two more tracks on the release to get through that make this such a trial to get through at certain stages for the music throughout is exceptionally accomplished and well-written bursts of sonic brutality| but the fact that there’s so much of it makes for an exhaustive listen| especially on the second half with an assorted number of rather bland and seemingly uninspired tracks used to beef up the running time on an album already overloaded to start with. That may be the album’s second biggest flaw| where this is usually a much tighter and more consistent act but brings about too many instances of sloppy riffing and uninspired passages that it tends to make a wandering second half even longer.The first half to this is easily the more consistent of the two parts even with an enjoyable mix between them. Intro ‘Six Feet of Foreplay’ is a serviceable noise-bearing intro with creaking door samples and clanking tools as a creepy child-like tone and sweeping orchestral interlude sweep through the remaining noise| effectively and appropriately setting the stage for the chaos to come. Proper first effort ‘The Extirpation Agenda’ sets off with unrelenting chaotic drum-patterns| screeching guitars and brutal rhythms collide into a frantic| noisy grinder with jagged guitar rhythms and chugging patterns against dexterous| mechanical drumming and furious tempos throughout that emerge from the blistering chaos of the drumming as the raging tempos slice through the frantic and extreme riff-work that incorporate more urgent rhythms and up-tempo ferocity into the guitar patterns that come off nicely in the final half. This chaos is continued in the title track| with crushing| intense riffs collide through battering drumming awash in technically-precise patterns with razor-edged guitars slicing through the chaotic fury around them as the furious energy and maddening vocals match the technicality to be found within the first half as the tempo drops for a melodic undercurrent through the solo section full of dynamic variations and changeovers as the tight| blasting fury is unleashed in the final half| easily one of the better songs in their catalog. Finally| setting up a brutal threesome to start off| ‘An Enumeration of Cadavers’ throws brutal drumming and tight razor-edged riffs bristle forth at a chaotic tempo with blinding drumming and sweeping chugs that bury the notes in a blizzard of tight riffs and indecipherable sweeps that add to the remorseless drum-beats and frantic double-bass patterns against a series of atmospheric sections that injects slight melodies into the fray that continue into the pounding set-up to the extravagant solo section and carries through to the final half with jaded rhythms| frantic guitar patterns and barreling drumming| making for one walloping start. The sampled movie effects and dialog of ‘Your Entitlement Means Nothing’ turns into blinding| scaling drumming and whiplash riffing whipping out a series of extremely tight| high-speed riffs creating a scathing| chaotic sense of brutality against the mechanical drum-patterns and melodic leads that slow down the later half against the chugging rhythms and pounding drum attack| slightly falling off from the blistering intro. Things pick back up with another stellar collection of back-to-back tracks as ‘The Davidian Deceit’ scores well with immediate jagged riff-work and pounding drumming that barrels along with brutal| raging rhythms that continue through the full-on drumming attacks filled with dexterous pounding| remorseless double-bass blasts and dynamic fills that match the equally brutal jagged guitar riffing that switches from intense fluid picking to tight| brutal chugging that injects some melodic sweeping into the solo section before heading back to the brutal riffing and pounding drumming in an extended series of technical sweeps and melodic leads before a sampled fade-out. This is followed with the appropriate first-single ‘Coffin Upon Coffin|’ as the slow| dirty riff-work and dexterous drumming alongside bristling melodies immediately turns into brutal blasting with tight chugging| frantic patterns and intense double-bass blasting that keeps the razor-wire riffing pattern as frantic and jagged as possible with sharp-edged rhythms and plenty of full-throttle blasting drumming that slows down into a melody-filled solo section augmented by the harmonious guitar leads that quickly return into full-throttle blast territory to weave through tight chugging and more mid-tempo guitar work in the chaotic final half| marking two more stellar tracks together and ending the first half with a lot to really like about it.While this is where the problems in the album do start popping up| there’s still a lot to like in the second half. ‘Chronicles of Detruncation’ feels like many of the better tracks up-top with immediate blasting and intense riff-work collide into a frantic| mid-tempo chug with dexterous drumming and brutal patterns against the mid-tempo rhythms that continue through the rather frantic guitars that get overshadowed by the blindingly brutal drum-blasts that carry through the tight chugging and relentless tempos that continue through the blinding drum-blasts and chaotic rhythms that allow the jagged riffing to cut through with a sense of viciousness that anchors the melodic leads against the brutality with a dexterous solo section amid tight chugging blasts| brutal rhythms and a frantic finale| and really should’ve been placed there but makes the transition into the following tracks a little easier. ‘Sade & Libertine Lunacy’ is one of the problematic tracks| as the tight| relentless blasting and a mid-paced series of jagged riffing that allows the brutal blasting into the forefront which the jagged guitar rhythms work over into a series of brutal sweeps and chugs through the main rhythm that features enough blasting drumming and chaotic razor-wire riffing to influence the brutal speed-drenched patterns into far more chaotic patterns and buzzing riff-work in the second half with a melodic solo section breaking up the brutality momentarily as the chaotic buzzing| frantic drumming and intense guitar riffs carry this through the second half into the strong finale ends up feeling like many of their other tracks and feels like a filler track. The utterly inappropriate ‘Die Verzweiflung|’ with its eerie droning riff-work and chaotic samples against steady riffing| dexterous double-bass and simple chords along the droning| crawling pace with discordant sweeps| tight background chugging and low vocals over the slow| sweeping patterns into an extended fade-out| has no place on the album and really should’ve been worked over more as the second half of the track should’ve been used as the starting point for another track. Thankfully| this worrisome two-fer is fixed with ‘Excremental Veracity|’ as the tight| crushing drumming and razor-wire chug-riffing that keeps the chaotic patterns along the up-tempo pace with the stuttering rhythms and intense patterns along the series of frantic double-bass blasts and chugging riffs that barrel through the up-tempo grinding pace in the mid-section with a strong lead-in to the solo section with melodic tones and steady drumming that leads into frantic blasting| tight chords and buzzsaw riffing that sweeps through the final half with a strong chaotic touch in the fade out feels like good times after the two missed tracks. Another going-through-the-motions effort| ‘Purity of Perversion|’ starts off strong with steady rolling drumming and mid-tempo riffs roll through the mid-tempo riff-work with a series of sweeping drum-patterns and chaotic blasts thrown into the burgeoning pace that brings iin more chaotic and utterly relentless riffing with blindingly chaotic drum-patterns and sweeping bass-lines into the slower| mid-range section with chugging riff-work and simpler riffing into a strong solo section with strong melodic work and simple drumming that works back into the chaotic buzzsaw riffing and blasting drum-patterns in the finale| but by the end it doesn’t do anything special and just feels like any other track here. The same applies to ‘Of Dead Skin & Decay’ where the sampled dialog leads into crashing drumming and rolling double-bass with tight| dense chugging rhythms and chaotic blasting with up-tempo and bouncy rhythms along the restrained and serviceable mid-section patterns that work in steady| streamlined riffing along the blasting drum-work that adds extra intensity against the raging riff-work as a series of melodic sweeps leads into the solo section augmented by vicious blasting that carries through the tight| intense chugging and drumming that leads into an extended discordant| swirling guitar fade-out that tends to run it’s course quite early. Thankfully| one of the better efforts is saved for last with the epic ‘Cenobites’ as the bleed-through discordant| swirling guitar intro which drags into tight| frantic blasting and thrashing| up-tempo riff-work that adds an extra speed element to the pace with the fluid rhythms meshing with the controlled chaotic drum-patterns that leads into a sweeping series of stuttering| technical rhythms that adds ethereal keyboards into the raging| tight guitars and blasting drumming that continues through the second half with ferocious speeds and intense patterns while the melodic guitar swirling and lighter patterns bring about a finer sense of calm with the lessened pace leading into the dynamic solo section atop dexterous double-bass fills and melodic sections against the droning riff-work that leads through the extended finale| making for one last impressive blast to send this one out on a rather higher note.One more time into the breach for these brutal mongers| and it serves them well that this is as good as it is against their vast and enjoyable catalog| for this readily contains all the elements that make this band so enjoyable and entertaining. This has the trademark relentless and brutality that were originally a huge focus in their sound| there’s doses of melody at the right moment| and the fact that it sweeps the two together with all the subtlety of a barbed-wire-spitting chainsaw is a strong feature| though the fact that there’s a few faults at work here does hold this back from becoming as impactful as its predecessor. All this makes for a solid and highly-enjoyable if not as immediate release.
58,72,One Step Forward| Two Steps Back...,0.71,Two years after a fine return to form with their critically lauded Global Flatline| Belgium's death metal machine Aborted returns with another slab of gore soaked technicality. The Necrotic Manifesto is the band's eighth full length album since their formation in 1995 and serves to bridge the gap between blistering fast yet technical death metal and chugging stomps and squeals. If aren't really sure what to expect| then brace yourself for technical| razor sharp guitar riffs| deep throaty| gravelly growls and insanely fast| breakneck drumming| but with some modern touches around the edges.The first few track hearken to the glory days of Aborted| when they played fast and brutal death metal with no frills. After a brief intro| “The Extirpation Agenda” blasts off with abandon featuring fast paced trem picking and precisely blasting drums| going through a variety of tempos| while the album's title track and “An Enumeration of Cadavers” blast away with grinding drums and razor sharp riffing. Despite all of the blasting and technicality| the band finds a way to incorporate the rhythmic chugging of their middle era and some surprisingly melodic lead guitar lines without completely losing their alluring balls out heaviness.By the time you reach the middle of the album| the lazy chugging and squeals begin to overpower the technical style of riffing. The drums stay incredibly proficient| but the guitars just drag the rest of the music down. “Entitlement Means Nothing”| edgy title aside| is one of the worst offenders. The overly modern sound bogs down the music and the band's trademark technical flair is zero. The same with “Coffin Upon Coffin” as the band opts for chug-chug| squeal instead of the razor bladed feistiness we've come to adore. Frankly| after the auditory reaming I received during the first few tracks| it's downright disappointing.If anything| The Necrotic Manifesto could be seen as a mix of the band's tried and true death metal with their chugging dances with deathcore that presented on Strychnine.213 and the somewhat melodic metalcore leanings of The Archaic Abattoir. Don't get me wrong| this is nowhere near the abomination that Strychnine.213 was| but there are traces of the lazy chugs throughout. I really don't get how Aborted can sound so lazy at times and other times just completely have their shit together. Listen to “Excremental Veracity”| with its solid mix of caveman stomps and blistering grind and you'll wonder how the hell the band let things like “Die Verzweiflung” through the cracks.I do have to say| that even with all of the modern frills| it's impressive that vocalist Sven de Caluwé| the only original member left| has kept the band's base sound intact through so many lineup changes. Sure they have been steadily reaching towards a more modern sound but it's still a sound that is decidedly Aborted. While Global Flatline was a step back towards the Aborted of old| I feel like The Necrotic Manifesto takes them back towards the modern sound of The Archaic Abattoir and Strychnine.213. It's a sound that's not fully rooted in the band's razor sharp| technical blasting but it's not fully rooted in the chugging deathcore style either. It's a solid mix of the two styles and| despite a few glaring turds in the pile| The Necrotic Manifesto is a decent addition to Aborted's discography.Written for The Metal Observer.
59,73,Back to the Future Part IV: Retrogore,0.8,Depending on who you talk to| Aborted can be classified as either brutal death metal or death metal| however| I like to think of them as brutal death metal. For one| the album of topic today| Retrogore| is by far a brutal death metal album. This thing drills away at your brain for almost all of it’s 50 minutes with blast beats| insane vocals by the very distinguishable Svencho| and guitar solos that I’m not even sure are humanly possible. However| I digress.Aborted| for lack of a better term| are such a cool band. I always have looked forward to their releases because they’re very intriguing and appealing. The artworks are colorful and well-thought-out| the themes of the albums are always interesting| and the way the material is presented can make even non-metal listeners check out what they have to offer. In the case of Retrogore| the theme is nostalgia| mad scientists| and of course: gore. When you start the album| you’re greeted by some grainy elevator music that sounds like the background music for an 80’s Cheerio’s commercial. It really sets the mood perfectly for the absolute crusher that is the title track. It feels like an abrasive punch when “Retrogore” kicks in with all instruments on 11. The song is structured similar to other Aborted songs| with a blinding fast guitar section followed by a low-tempo chorus guaranteed to send you into a self-frenzied mosh. However| something seems different here. Their last offering| The Necrotic Manifesto| was pretty boring in my opinion. Svencho and Co. must have been feeling pretty similar because the first half of this album is filled with awesome guitar hooks| macabre recordings of evil science experiments| and a lot of tempo changes. “Termination Redux” has some addictive galloping guitar parts and a changing chorus section which is definitely a unique standout on this album. However| my gripe with this album came after about the 6th or 7th track. It just sounded like one big song to me| similar to Serpents Unleashed by Skeletonwitch not musically but structurally. By no way did the instrumentation or energy die down| I simply was retro-bored. My favorite song on the album is “Bit By Bit” because of it’s shear heaviness. The chugging is palpable and the chorus had me singing along with Svencho and really pumped me up.Lyrically I have nothing bad to say about this album. Svencho really is a terrific vocalist and his growls are among the most unique in extreme music. They are very guttural and sound indistinguishable from his performance on The Necrotic Manifesto. I really enjoyed this lyrical bit from “Cadaverous Banquet” where Svencho pays tribute to what seems a more twisted profile of the iconic villain “Leatherface” from “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” or more likely an embodiment of serial killer Ed Gein:“Your body is mine for the takingShot thrice| cranium excavatedDelusional armour| your cadaver my shrinePleasure holes depravedBy the relentless thrust of my blade”These are great gorey lyrics that really paint a picture of the madness Aborted bring with their music.TL;DR: Aborted deliver a great addition to their discography with a fun| interesting| brutal record that’s filled with enough surprises and lore to keep anyone interested| to a degree.Originally written for www.qjukebox.com
60,75,good aussie death,0.8,this is a decent debut album from Abortus. it was self released so the production and art work isnt outstanding but hey its death metal not power metal its ment to grind! my major problem with the album is its length| it runs for just under half an hour. i like my albums to go for about 45 minutes at least but that aside if you are looking for some good Australian death metal these are the guys to check out| after recently touring Europe after getting a record deal (masacare i believe?) they are one of our forerunners at the moment. the songs on this album are all solid with some catchy rhythms and plenty of energy to get your blood pumping| i recomend it to any death metal fan.
61,77,Roaring thunder from down under,0.8,"The Australians have always managed to put interesting spins on already existing heavy metal genres| perhaps some of the best examples include Disembowelment's ""Transcend the Peripheral"" which made everyone stop and rethink how the genre of death/doom could possibly be done. Not sure exactly what was going on down there during the 1990's| but that band was not alone in finding ways to tinker with an established formula for extreme music.Enter stage left| Abramelin. Named after the Egyptian mage who appeared in a book by the same name (this was back when bands didn't need complex names| they just picked something that sounded pretty cool|) these Aussies laid forth a chunk of brutal death metal in 1995. Around that time| the established sound of the Florida scene and even in other areas such as Sweden had begun to morph into something else as bands attempted to prevent stagnation. One such new avenue of creativity was to simply get heavier| louder| and more punishing| and by those standards Abramelin's self-titled debut delivers on every level.Don't get me wrong| this is not an album that is easy to like early on| as goes with alot of recordings of its kind. The compositions have a tendency to go in unorthodox directions at times| a little unncessary drumming here or maybe some unexpected twist there. Parts of this album can be downright ugly| thus making it even harder for the average fan to absorb. This all said| songs like ""Spiritual Justice"" and ""Misfortune"" deliver the goods with straight forward pummeling that is akin to have brain surgery performed on you with a jackhammer and no anathesia. Elsewhere| the band shows a bit of ambition| such as the two ""Stargazer"" songs| but even then this rarely leaves the realm of unapologetic brutal death.Sadly for these guys| it would be the only album of theirs that got much attention at all| and even then it wasn't much. They only released one album after this| the inferior ""Deadspeak"" before collapsing sometime in 2002 or so| never to be heard from again. Some members formed The Beserker| a band I've never been particularly fond of. So| as it stands| Abramelin gave us one album to revel in| even its hardly an easy listen the first couple of times through."
62,78,Another masterpiece from Down Under,0.83,I have to admit that it’s been far too long between buying| and reviewing| this little Australian gem.For those unfamiliar| Abramelin is a project from Australia that was mistreated – undergoing a ridiculous amount of line-up changes| instability and such| when the music was quite good. The music in question| is a tribute to old-school straight-up death metal| but with hints of melody and even a slight groove. Audible vocals that| with a lyrics booklet| can actually be deciphered| also a pleasant change from the usual overly guttural vocals in death metal.The story goes that Abramelin| somewhat of a supergroup| released an album that was| at the time| the pinnacle of DM. Extremely offensive lyrics resulted in the album being pulled from the stores in most states. This only served to fuel the desire and publicity| and the band became immensely popular in the underground. Facing a big challenge with only two members used to record on this album| Simon Dower on vocals| and Tim Aldrige on instruments| after four years| “Deadspeak” was released and it is superior on every level to the one that got Abramelin their career start.The technicality| whilst still retaining its firmly old-school roots| has advanced hugely on this release. The guitar work is less straight forward chords and has become much more tremolo-based picking| but still not the “hyper-fast” which| while good in some cases| I imagine wouldn’t really fit Abramelin’s music.Guitar solos on the album deserve their own section. The soloing is just incredible. It’s quite simple for solo work| but it’s beautifully melodic| and effective. It’s done with precision| yet without self-indulgent wankery. They’re impeccable really – just done so well| and the simple riffing that often accompanies it makes the experience even better. Listen especially to the solo on “Waste” and you’ll see what I mean.Lyrical matter is fairly filthy| as could be expected. Opening “Pleasures” is one of the most obscene songs ever written| surely! The written material is not for those with a weak heart or an easily upset stomach| but could we expect anything less from a band whose first album was pulled due to lyrical content?Another highlight is that for a death metal album| you’ll get lots of bang for your buck. There are only 7 tracks| but they are all very long| at least half of them beating the 5-minute mark – with the album clocking in at about 40 minutes. But very little of those 40 minutes are anything even close to filler| or undesirable to listen to.The absolute major standout track of the album is the epic album closer| “Plague”. This song is just one of the most brilliantly crafted and well-thought out songs ever written. Starting with an absolutely beautiful acoustic guitar and cello piece| “Plague” is a mid-tempo song| but it doesn’t take away from the intensity. It just has so many amazingly well written riffs that are catchy| ferociously violent| and groovy at the same time| most especially the one that starts at 6:32 – one of the best riffs ever written| and then when it gets a harmony added to it – just you try and not bang your head to it.Summing up| this album should be heard at any cost. Old-school gore| ferocity and violence has never collaborated with melody and beauty so well| and may never again.Points detracted for a slightly irritating drum machine| and some inconsistency in the quality of the music. But all in all| one of the best and most underground releases ever| by one of the least-known supergroups ever – just good luck to you trying to find it.Stand out tracks| starting with the best:PlaguePleasuresFlesh FurnaceYour Casualty
63,79,Noid's first listen.,0.7,General description in terms of genre: Progressive| Thrash-based Death Metal.Comparison smashing: Nothing really jumps out straight away| but after a few repeats| one notices similarities to the more straight-forward aspect of Strapping Young Lad| slower sections of Acid Bath| and a Meshuggah-esque vocal styling.How did I come across it?: Colleague presented me a copy for the purpose of this review.Lyrics and vocals: While it may not be intended| the theme most prevalent in the lyrics comes across as a source of anger caused by the desire for an instant karmic reaction to the general inconsideration shown towards others by the greater public. There are of course| other personal and social issues addressed| but they all seem to be centered around that already stated.The best way to describe the vocals would be to say that a type of semi-scream is used. Akin to the Meshuggah| and Devolved vocalists| there is much more voice involved| as opposed to the gurgle/rasp form of vocal distortion. Frequently| there is a definite indistinction between the inflections of each line.Drums: It's as though an anthology of all the typical| straight-ahead Thrash/Death beats has been not only presented in its basic form| but also publicised in a manner conveying just how to switch between them whilst incorporating Rock and Doom Metal influences. Blasts appear occasionally| throwing the more current wave of Grind into the mix for good measure. These are functional as bridges for the most part| and are never sloppy. Fills are a constant| but interesting in their own right because of their nature in pitch| rather than rhythm. Something here reminds me of Jimmy Kyle in the switching of dominance from each section of the kit throughout| which draws attention to the light cymbal work. The Strapping Yound Lad comparison was drawn by the tempo| and gallopping kicks.Bass: Tends to sit right up the guitar's arse with no real force or presence being contributed. This is partly due to the production. Really| it only serves to display the need for interplay. More conventionally| this is a second guitarist's realm of input| rather than the guitarist-playing-bass mode heard here. They have no problems keeping pace with the other members| although nothing noteworthy is being submitted.Guitar: Staccato| rhythmical riffing laden with quirky timing and choppy patterns. Impressive picking speed and harmonic progression are the secondary observations. No soloing as such| since most of the drive is derived from the rhythmic input.Production: (More often than not| this is the fatal point for many bands| but accounting for the fact that this was self-financed during a period of instability| I'll lower the bar a tad.)First point of note| is that overall| the mix is a bit thin. The drums have been captured almost perfectly| but everything is somewhat flat in regards to cymbals and snare as both don't really pierce. An extra layer of guitar appears to be required| mainly to separate the frequency ranges and emphasise technique| as well as adding to the attack. In doing so| the bass could be raised| and play more of a role. Without EQ manipulation| the high quality of recording is not self-evident. Despite this| the entirety is of a good standard| and better than expected from independent releases.Noid's verdict: For fuck's sake| somebody pick these guys up. I for one| am fucking sick of bands like Contrive| who add nothing whatsoever to the maturing process of the Metal genre in Australia| being heralded across the board| while those with the correct ethics are ignored. That said| I'm not suggesting that you achieve a state of inebriety and masturbate in a dark room to this album| or even stating that it will force you to sit back and take heed for that matter. What it WILL do is make you adjust your personal method of critique. I hate Thrash with vehemence| but this release captures that which should be retained within the particular sub-genre. Abrasion are only halfway towards successfully melding Death amongst it all however. Without a second guitarist| much of the aggression and technicality is repressed| especially when the bass is passive-passive for the most part| but what there is atones by not settling into the ultimately boring as fuck Swedish or Finnish melodic form; a la Soilwork| Darkane| and Children of Bodom. The most obvious point of contention immediately present to myself is the vocals. By no means do I require growling/rasping for enjoyment to be attained| but there is a certain lack of variety that unsettles me. The style itself is different enough| and that they're supplied in tangent with guitar is worthy of praise. These guys are onto a good thing here| of that I have no doubt| but I can not help feeling that some recognition from a decent label| coupled with the inherent networking and guidance| would expand the aural effect tremendously in the course of something as simple as bolstered spirits.Verdict in a single sentence: Favourable| yet lacking in key departments.
64,81,Grave offerings,0.7,Abscession are basically nothing else but straight up Swedish sounding death metal band (hailing from Germania though haha!). And yeah| I know that many of you will immediately start yawning from boredom when hearing a great number of the same sounding bands| with the same influences| style| etc. Yeah| I can understand that| but on the other hand I am so deeply infected with the Swedish death metal style that my tolerance for this music is very big. And I am not really bothered if band X sounds unoriginal and brings nothing new and if band Y sounds exactly the same as band X. It just doesn’t matter| as long as the music is good| then everything is fine. Obviously such bands and such albums will most likely perish unnoticed and will never get a status of “classics” or something “timeless”. But diehard collectors will be always be coming back to them| I guess. How’s that related to “Grave Offerings”? Well| as mentioned before| this is not an album that will bring anything new or extraordinary. It is not an album that will get a wide recognition. Finally| it surely it not an album that goes above the average quality of the current new wave of old school death metal. As such| it is solid| but actually pretty mediocre. Which doesn’t mean it’s bad or something.Starting with what I like the most about “Grave Offerings”| it would surely be the catchiness of this album. Damn| it is very memorable and easily listenable. Already since the first spin you will know some of these riffs or melodies and they’ll come back to you fast. The album plays smoothly| it’s so damn easy to listen to that you almost doesn’t realize when it’s over and you wanna play it again. Obviously there are some very strong riffs| some great moments… and well| I surely like those more aggressive ones the most (with songs like “Where Sleeping Gods Dwell”| “Gargoyle” and “Freshly Dug Graves”). Abscession digs the tomb of Swedish death metal and brings sometimes quite worn out| clichéd riffs and arrangements| but I like it anyway and listen to this CD with a pleasure. But yeah| it’s a double edged sword and for many listeners this will be the case “oh| I heard it way too many times before| too many times in better performance”| etc. I agree. But the whole performance of Abscession on “Grave Offerings” is as solid as it can be from a debuting underground band and I see no reason why fans of (Swedish) death metal should not like this. This album has many hooks| many nice melodic pieces| some great aggressive parts| and it’s simply good.I need to point out that two songs come quite different from the rest of the material. First| the closing song “Downfall Pt 1” is a kind of ten minutes long monster| which you can divide into two parts. First one is pretty standard Swedish death metal but the second goes into very doomy| epic sounding style that may remind you some slower Hypocrisy songs mixed with a bit of Edge of Sanity| with piano and even clean vocals used. I even enjoyed it| but to be honest I was not so much convinced about all these pianos and clean vocals. Another of the two songs and the one which I prefer more is “In My Coffin”| which is very doomy| but at the same time it’s so damn heavy and vicious. And in this case I’m not even bothered about the clean vocals that appear in this song haha! No| this is very| very good song. I can compare it to Bloodbath a lot| they used to have quite few similar songs on their early albums!So| all in all| a decent debut from Abscession. It’s already been almost two years since “Grave Offerings” and it looks like it didn’t get that much recognition| what can prove me right that it’s a solid album| but also “one of many”. I enjoyed it| some more fans of Swedish death metal will also. Everybody else who are more of the moaning type of listeners should get something else and not waste their time.Standout tracks: “Where Sleeping Gods Dwell”| “Gargoyle”| “In My Coffin”| “Freshly Dug Graves”Final rate: 70/100
65,81,Awesome Swedish death metal newcomer,0.89,Review originally published at www.teethofthedivine.com by E.Thomas.I’m pretty sure that 2014/15 has been the strongest year for the Swedish Death metal revival movement since the genre reignited back in 2008/09. And its just not bigger names like Bloodbath| Entrails| Feral| Just Before Dawn| Puteraeon |Revel in Flesh| Usurpress| Brutally Deceased| Wombbath or dusted of compilations and of ‘lost classics’ like Goddefied| Sorcery and Festerday. New| fresh| often obscure hungry bands are crawling from every corner of the world and delivering the goods as bands like Bottlekopf| Hereza| Wreckage| Unwilling Flesh| Come Back From the Dead| Carnation | Cult of Endtime| Skelethal| Mass Burial| Austerymn| Smothered| Disrupted| Infected Chaos| Morbid Vomit and many others have risen from the Grave and kicked all kinds of ass.At the top of the latter list| is Swedish new comers Abscession and their debut| Grave Offerings| released earlier this year on fledgling Final Gate Records (also home to the equally kickass Carnation)| but only now finding its way to my ear| and might be the best of the bunch of the newcomers. Comprised of guys from bands I have not heard of like Throne of Heresy| Zombie Destrüktion| Die| Putrescent Secretancy | Aphelionand Cascade| this collective has come together to deliver absolutely one of the better Grave/Entombed/Dismember worships I have heard lately. And as you can tell from the opening overly name dropping paragraph I have heard a lot.Everything you’d expect from the genre is here| importantly that mid range guitar tone is spot on (mastered by Dan Swano)| deep| buzzing and reverb laden along with a thick bass and gruff powerful vocals| you know the sound. However| what sets these guys apart is the songs. These guy absolutely have that ‘it’ factor when if comes to delivering catchy| raucous| romping Swedish death metal gallops. Dare I say| there is even a bit of playful/fun factor to many of these canters despite the usual dark. death metal themes. For example| the opening duo of “Where Sleeping Gods Dwell” and “Gargoyle” contain two of the albums best cuts with big beefy| but in credibly catchy riffs| with “Gargoyle” (along with Mass Burial‘s “Its a Zombie”) arguably being one of my favorite songs of the genre in recent memory.And the rest of the album isn’t chopped liver| all 10 tracks just deliver on a near perfect level. Whether its the slow burn of “In My Coffin” | the Hail of Bullets styled rumble of “Cabin 13”| snarling chug of “Plague Bearer”| more uptempo blast of “Engorged With Gore” and such| all are top notch and up there with the Bloodbaths and Entrails of the genre And what really helps the material is the number of nice solos from Niel Anilao| who gives track like “The Ruiner” some real flair atop the standard Stockholm burl. Then there’s the moody 10 minute closer| “Downfall part 1”| which features a piaon and clean vocal break about halfway through| to show the bands more progressive side. I cant wait for part 2.Grave Offerings is yet another outstanding addition to a scene that shows no signs of letting up| and the quality seems to be as amazing as the quantity| and I’m drinking it all up!
66,87,Good (new+old) school death metalliqe,0.87,"A couple of weeks ago there was a concert in a little town somewhere in Bavaria where the band of a few friends played and apart from them| I wasn't expecting anything too interesting or overall anything I would like. I sure was surprised when these dudes stepped on stage or should I say when they started playing. Absorb have been around quite some time now (1989)| but it seems they have been having trouble releasing/recording/writing stuff since they only have a couple of demos and a Legacy 4-way split flying around| with the exception of their 2010 (!) album ""Dealing With Pain"". So when their show was over I asked one of the dudes if I could have a CD for a review and here it is.After putting this thing in my cd player| I was really amazed to hear a really cool| slightly fuzzy production that really reminds one of the old days of old school death metal. Yeah it's mushy| its dirty| and intense. It basically fulfills every cliché you know or heard about old school death metal; it's groovy| downtuned| aggressive as fuck| and smashes you with fast-paced punk-like rhythms and doomy chuggy riffs. I'm not sure where this album was recorded| but as far as the production goes they did an overall good job since no instrument is mixed too loud or too thin. The sound| however| is a little damped down| but it's not really a problem in this case. ""Dealing With Pain""'s songs are very similar in approach| but since you want to hear a decent coherent death metal album and not a single collection of your favorite pop band| this is a good thing. I really like the singer's vocals on this one as I've liked them live. He manages to bring a lot of volume to his voice and sounds really pissed. Now ""singing"" in death metal (or any other extreme genre) can be a very difficult thing since| for an ""outsider""| everything seems to sound monotonous| but for a connoisseur| each and every grunt has it's own flavor. This dude really does that magical thing that can be heard in the ranks of bands such as Entombed or Dismember| an aggressive grunt with a raspy tone to it.Generally| if you like straight balls out death metal| then you should give this a listen since it rocks. If you are on the lookout for that special obscure| yet old school gem that you don't have yet| go get this album. Yeah it may be a couple of decades too late| but it's always better late than never. I really wonder where these guys would have gone on the cult totem if they released more stuff back in the day. Give it a try."
67,90,A phenomenal debut,0.97,"There are a few bands today that deserve so much praise| and Abysmal Dawn are one of those few bands. They deserve to be among the high ranks of death metal gods such as Suffocation| Gorguts| Obituary| Death and Carcass to name a few. This album is very inspiring and has a lot of heavy melodic brutality to it. I'm surprised that there aren't multiple reviews for this album| considering how true it is to the death metal scene. There is nothing stupid| bad or cheesy about this album. A lot of effort was put into it. The production is good| everything sounds good| and I like the atmosphere that the band was able to create. Abysmal Dawn are original and have a distinct sound like no other. I can't think of any flaws except that there are a couple recycled| bland riffs| but that's about it. The vocalist/lead guitarist/songwriter| Charles Elliott| shows good musicianship with cool harmonic minor lead guitar work and heavy riffs accompanied by his incredible songwriting ability and a powerful voice. His growls are brutal| and his high shrieks are sick| and it fits well with the music. He's one of my favorite vocalists| and his voice puts the lame deathcore and metalcore vocalists to shame. Not only does he make great metal music| but he even looks metal.I like the feel that the band was able to create with the solos and melody. Terry Barajas did an excellent job on the drums| giving a good sense of purpose to them that I really enjoyed| and I'm a guitarist. I liked the drums a lot| they have a good pace to them with a proper amount of double bass and awesome| sheer brutality fills. The other guitarist| Jamie Boulanger| did a good job displaying his soloing capabilities. The solos are excellent| with a middle eastern sound to it| props to the harmonic minor scale that he uses just like Charles| as I've mentioned before. Much respect to these musicians| they play their instruments well. For being a straight up death metal band| they got a lot of creativity and I never got bored listening to this album| which is something that great albums possess.It's hard to say which track is my favorite| cause they're all great. ""In The Hands Of Death"" is a killer track after the instrumental ""Impending Doom"" and ""Blacken The Sky"" is a good melodic heavy song. ""Salting The Earth"" and ""Servants To Their Knees"" are the most brutal tracks on here in my opinion. All of the tracks on here kick ass. Some of them are technical too| but not to the point where it takes the heaviness and brutality away. If you're looking for a new band to get into| especially if you're looking for some fresh| original kick ass death metal| then I recommend you to get this album| you won't be disappointed. It is the best modern death metal release and one of the best I've ever heard. I stand strong with this album and band. No poser bullshit with this band whatsoever."
68,90,Not bad| not great,0.79,"Admittedly| I am a sucker for generic Brutal Death Metal. Abysmal Dawn is one of those bands that do absolutely nothing different| yet plays the style so competently that there isn't much to complain about. Of course| there are the Human Filleted type of bands (the kind that rip off Suffocation to the point of tedium)| but I find that bands like this one can usually play with enough ferocity and intensity to make me overlook the obvious similarities.Most of these songs follow the same basic idea and contain the same basic ingredients| but the band bakes such a damn fine cake that I really wouldn't ask for much else. Every song contains a Suffocation-style groove at some point| the low vocals are reminiscent of Mads Haarløv while the higher ones remind me somewhat of a higher David Vincent| and the drumming is a nice Pete Sandoval-type mixture of relentless blast beats and tasteful fills. If there is anything that helps set Abysmal Dawn apart from the hordes of similar bands| it's that there is a slight modern tinge in the riffage. It's kind of hard to explain| but there is a certain latent groove underneath the typical Death Metal riffs that reflect the current time somewhat. Listen to the opening of ""In the Hands of Death"" or the middle section of ""State of Mind"". This actually doesn't hinder the music that much| and they can usually pull it off rather well| but the similarity to them and some of the riffs on Black Dahlia Murder's first album are rather striking.The biggest problem here though| is repetition. There is no denying that they know what they are doing| and are certainly a competent group of musicians| but I'm just not so sure about their writing abilities. None of these songs suck| but ""Salting the Earth"" uses a riff damn near identical to the first one of ""In the Hands of Death"". The similarity to Black Dahlia Murder hits home once again here| when you realize that a majority of these riffs are just reworked versions of the first few. This could be a sticking point for some| but for me it's just a minor point of contention. I would usually say that hopefully the band could improve on the next record| but Abysmal Dawn's newest album| Programmed to Consume fell victim to the trend of becoming more and more technical| thus sacrificing songwriting in the process. So From Ashes may well end up being the band's finest hour| and it's an acceptable| if derivative| slice of Death Metal.Originally written for www.metalcrypt.com"
69,91,It's Alright...,0.68,"And that's all this album is| really. It's alright| its okay| and it's very standard. Every riff on here| every groove| every drumbeat| and every growl...is standard and kind of nonexistent. Now| I was given this album by a friend to listen to| and I only had a little amount of interest when I recieved it in a trade. The first few listens ended with me dissatisfied| I didn't even care that I had used up forty minutes of the day; it just seemed like another album. And that's where this album falls down on its face. As I've said about five times already| this album is standard technical death metal. Although the band can write a good riff (see: intro to 'Twilight's Fallen' or 'Grotesque Modern Art')| they seem content with pedal point riffs that don't do much for the song or for the album| either. The guitars are tuned low (B| I think) to give it a bit of chunk because I don't think this album would sound heavy without the heavy detuning| and the guitars have this airy| modern sound that really gets on my nerves. I'm a huge fan of those old South American buzzsaw tones| and this is about as far away from those as possible. The riffs| as I said before| either consist of pedal points| technical idiocy| or the occasional really good death metal riff. The bass is absolutely nonexistent. I've heard later-era Slayer albums with more bass presence. It's sad| really. The drums are competent for a modern technical death metal release. What I mean by that| is that you get your helpings of blast beats| huge double bass fills and patterns| and rolls from hell. Now this is fine and dandy| but this permeates the album with a feeling of ""look at me guys"". The vocals are most definitely the highlight here. Really| Mr. Elliot is a phenomenal vocalist in all categories. His lows have a gurgle and power that remind of Mikael Akerfeldt| but a bit lower and a little less powerful| and his highs have this airy| but weak| quality to them. One issue I have with this album's vocals| is they all sound detuned in the studio| as if Charles can't go this low. He might be able to| but it just feels automated and processed.And| here is another issue. The production; I am a firm believer in analog recording| and especially cheap analog recording| and production like this album is just irritatingly clean. It feels as if robots are playing this album| but not in a group| as if they all have their own rooms and everything is handled with a stupidly mechanical feel.So| overall| the album is weak in the instrumental aspect| production aspects| and songwriting aspects| but strong in the vocal and lyrical categories. I don't recommend this for anyone| unless you really like modern tech death with a sheen so bright| you'll blind yourself."
70,91,A step into old school death metal,0.82,"Abysmal Dawns' latest release Programmed to Consume seems to take a step back to the beginning of death metal| with the intense thrashy riffs and blaring blast beats this album gets you pumped.The album opens up with the title track ""Programmed to Consume""| using some static and a deranged voice panning left to right and back again to give this apocalyptic feeling right from the start. At the end of this strange message you get the hear the power of the drums| the guitars| and something else| Elliot's vocals. They are nothing short of amazing switching it up from the low growls to these powerful highs which have some clarity to the pronunciations. There are a good amount of memorable tracks on this album i.e. Twilight's Fallen| Grotesque Modern Art| and this beautiful instrumental aeon Aomegas. Twilight's Fallen starts off with a catchy rhythm to it. It gives the drummer a chance to do more than the standard blasts and double bass. The chorus also features some nice backing vocals from Jacob Enfinger of Reciprocal| giving a strong foundation for the song.Now as I mentioned above aeon Aomegas is one of the most memorable tracks on Programmed to Consume. It lets Jamie Boulanger step into the spot light a bit| being that Elliot plays the majority of solos on the album. It shows that Abysmal Dawn does have some great writing talent. aeon Aomegas would have to be the most creative song on the album| given its not the most creative album|(but hey who cares it still sounds great)| the acoustic guitar| and rolling thunder in the background gives this song a nice dark feeling to it that leaves the listener in a pleasant awe by the end.So anyways Abysmal Dawns' Programmed to Consume does deserve a listen. I'm happy to have this in my collection| and hopefully they have more to come."
71,91,remember this name,0.75,My first exposure to Abysmal Dawn was the band’s 2006 debut album From Ashes which is one of the most uninspiring and insipid albums I’ve heard and it was only after some constant praise from a friend on the forums that I bothered giving this album a try. I have to say that I’m pretty glad I did.Abysmal Dawn’s Programmed to Consume is the band’s second full length out this year through Relapse. The band play a form of death metal that is derivative but at the same time is stuffed full of terrific grooves and the kind of hell for leather aggression that you expect from a death metal band. At the same time| there are enough touches of inspiration| changing of tempos| kickass soloing and slight flirtation with black metal to keep things always interesting.The band’s sound is a nice who’s who of classic death metal with songs bearing touches of everything from Malevolent Creation to Morbid Angel and Suffocation while the lead playing reminds me of Decapitated. It is in fact the guitar playing of Charles Elliot and Ian Jekelis that sets this band apart from a large chunk of their peers. The songs are full of great riffs that go from jackhammer intensity to slowed down atmospheric guitar parts and every song on this album has at least one really big fat groove. The high quality lead playing is simply the icing on the cake. Elliot also turns in a very good performance as vocalist alternating between a solid death metal growl a raspy voice that is very effective.Stand out tracks include album opener and title song Programmed to Consume| the mid paced groove monster Twilight’s Fallen| The Descent with its slight black metal feel mixed up with classic Morbid Angel and the superb album closer Walk the Path of Fire.Overall| Programmed to Consume is a high quality death metal album. The band is not doing anything new within the genre but much like Thorium| they stick to writing memorable songs within a well established framework and manage to pull off a very enjoyable album. Also| with the level of improvement between the debut and this album the band might well pull off something truly special next time around. As it is| they’ve come pretty close this time.

72,91,Original? Nope But Who Cares?,0.75,"I rarely do this but I bought this record on a whim. Yes I was actually lured by the little header that Relapse put and after listening to it at the store decided it was worth my money. What I have garnered upon multiple listens is that this record does not stretch the boundaries of metal| but rather does a good job at not conforming to the standard modern day ""uber tech kitchen sink with no balls"" sound that many a ""death metal"" band are trying nowadays. Abysmal Dawn do it the old fashioned way; pummeling yet groovy riffs along with monster vocals and guitar solos. Is there anything wrong with that? My favorite element of the band's sound is from the vocal aspect. Charles Elliot| the band's leader and main songwriter also has a devastating pair of pipes. His lows| which he uses most often are guttural| balsy and remind me of Mikael Aekerfeldt's delivery. His highs are not as awesome but nonetheless get the job done. The guitar playing is tight and concise| with the odd good solo thrown in for good measure. Nothing insanely shredderific but that is not this band's calling. They throw in a good amount of melody as well as straight-up pummeling and old school death metal grooves. Overall this is text book death metal. No gimmicks| no ""core"" to be found (thank Satan!). This band is a lot more metal than many modern day pretenders. As for album highlights| the opener and title track ""Programmed to Consume"" has some great moments| ""Grotesque Modern Art"" rocks and ""Aeon Aomegas"" is an acoustic interlude which reminds me of some early Gorguts moments and the closer ""Walk the Path of Fire"" is pretty brutal. As previously stated| there is nothing totally new about this band| rather they execute death metal pretty well. The band gets points for having done their homework. I hope this becomes more of a norm in the modern death metal scene."
73,91,Run-Of-The-Mill Death Metal,0.5,Simply put| “Programmed to Consume” is by-the-books death metal with standard thrashy riffs and speedy tremolo picking. The effort is lacking life| passion| and none of the songs feature anything resembling a hook. The only two real glimpses of creative hope was the acoustic break in the middle of the album| and the lyrical concepts spewed forth by vocalist Charles Elliot| which deal with some almost progressive content about science fiction and social commentaries. Charles is in fact the bands strongest point| with his growls resembling the powerful Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth| accented by high screams.As it stands| I personally don’t think all is lost. There are some subtle nasty melodies riding beneath the action. Perhaps Abysmal Dawn just needs another album to hit their stride| as I can almost feel a yearning for something different bubbling beneath the surface. If that day chooses to rear it’s ugly head| then that will be the day that Abysmal Dawn will truly be a force to be reckoned with.Originally posted at www.waytooloud.com
74,91,A Solid outting,0.7,"Death metal itself is a genre that has had it's ups and downs. In recent years| a select few bands have taken to stretching the boundaries of the genre in one direction or the other. Old school bands are coming back| hardcore breakdowns have made their way in (and have been ridiculously overdone)| and still others push the technical boundaries of what they do.Abysmal Dawn was originally brought to my attention for having a former member of L.A.'s Rise| a band I had the pleasure of seeing at Milwaukee Metalfest one year thinking that they stood out quite a bit. This CD has a LOT of elements| but none of them being too original. That being said| this is a very solid outting by a very capable band. I get a very 1997 vibe off of the whole thing. There are riffs that could have come straight off of Cannibal Corpse's more technical material of the day (which isn't to say it's tech-death by any stretch). Some of the drum/guitar interplay reminds me a little bit of latter-day Gorguts as well| but nowhere near as out-there with the oddball noises and pick scrapes. The blast beats are very few and far between| the typical speed of this disc is either plodding and slow or Slayer-beat. The vocals are kinda squashed in the mix...no mic cupping since the vocalist also plays guitar...kinda reminiscent of what Muhammed sounds like in Necrophagist. One thing the packaging said that confused me was that amidst all the death metal bands that the band was compared to| ""Testament"" was in there in bold print and I couldn't even picture that| but now after hearing a few guitar solos| I see what they're talking about. The soloing definitely has a Skolnick kind of vibe with the excess reverb and the occasional sweep arpeggio. Very cool.Originality isn't present here in the slightest. But if you're just looking for a kick-ass death metal disc| this is pretty damn good."
75,92,Abysmal Dawn - Leveling the Plane of Existence,0.8,"This is one of the better death metal releases in my opinion this year. The guys in Abysmal Dawn play semi technical death metal in the vein of old Morbid Angel. But its also pretty groovy at times as well which in the grand scheme of things works in their favor. Now the album clocks in at just under 40 minutes which is just about the perfect length I think. It isn't too short but doesn't drag on too long either.On vocals (and guitars) we have Charles Elliot and he does a pretty good job here. Elliot mainly uses a deeper death growl but bassist Mike Casio also chimes in with higher rasps as well from time to time. Just enough to change it up and make sure the vox aren't so one dimensional.As far as Elliot's skills with the guitar they are pretty good and the riffs are enjoyable. They are technical to a degree without having the listener lose interest in whats going on. I especially enjoy whats going on in In Service of Time which serves as the best cut on the album in my humble opinion. But its not all fast paced death metal there are a few slower numbers which are just as good like Perpetual Dormancy and The Sleeper Awakens. These two tracks break up the speed but flow well with the rest of the more technical tracks. The Sleeper Awakens is especially a nice album closer.The drumming of Scott Fuller isn't very showy its sort of your run of the mill death metal stuff. Its actually pretty tight and in no way sloppy but not over done which can annoy me with certain drummers. As usual there is quite a bit of blast beats and pretty constant double bass.Leveling the Plane of Existence gives us some in your face straight to the point death metal. The riffing doesn't get old and continues to be a good listen which is always great. And thankfully the songs are kept short instead of treading into the norms of some death metal bands to write ""epic"" songs that go off into the double digits for time. There is really nothing I can complain about accept if perhaps the drumming were a little more inventive| but that's about it."
76,92,Just Wait for the New Morbid Angel,0.6,"Abysmal Dawn is a straight-up death metal band from Los Angeles. I decided to pick up their third full-length| Leveling the Plane of Existence| based purely on the strength of the awesome album art. I'm not sure what it is| but it looks cool.Anyway| after listening to the album| I have one question. Didn't anyone tell these guys Morbid Angel are already releasing an album this year? Their tones are close replicas of Morbid Angel| and their mid-paced chugging riffs have MA written all over them. The solos are of the slow chromatic variety as well. But few of the riffs have the memorability of an MA riff| and the solos seem to be thrown together without any thought put into them. ""Rapture Renowned"" and ""Manufactured Humanity"" are completely and entirely forgettable.There are a few points of dim| obscured light| however. Other than a clumsy point in the solo of ""Rapture Renowned""| they play their instruments competently| and the death growls are competent as well. Closer ""The Sleeper Awakens"" changes things up quite a bit| sounding more like one of The Haunted's slower tracks. There is a catchy chorus to ""In Service of Time""| and ""My Own Savior"" gets a great groove going. Sadly| when they're at their best| it sounds even more like Morbid Angel| so as they gain in quality they lose in identity. The Verdict: Morbid Angel are already releasing an album this year. You're better off waiting for that. This is not a terrible album by any means| but it's not going to be remembered by year's end.originally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/"
77,92,Proving decent death metal can come from the U.S.,0.8,"A few days ago| Abysmal Dawn released their third full length Leveling the Plane of Existence| and it's fairly rad. This is one of those bands that makes America proud| showing that Europeans aren't the only ones who can write death metal that's brutal and well-composed at the same time. Think Suffocation| early Decrepit Birth| Hate Eternal and just a hint of Decapitated thrown into a blender| and you have the basic recipe for Abysmal Dawn.Right| let's get into this thing. The first thing that stood out for me on this album was its production value. It's funny I mentioned that they sound like Hate Eternal| because this album was mastered by none other than Erik Rutan| and his expertise really shines through here. The whole thing sounds crystal clear| but not in that sterile| overproduced way. No| what I mean by that is you can clearly hear everything going on at once; from the beefy riffs to the machine gun drums and shredding solos| nothing is left out. I wouldn't say it sounds organic| but it definitely sounds like real people playing real instruments and doing a damn good job at it| which leads me to my next topic| the music itself. As I said in the previous paragraph| the music on Leveling the Plane of Existence is very well written| settling comfortably into that gray area where it's not tech death but still much more technically proficient than your average death metal band. These guys didn't just slap a bunch of heavy-sounding riffs together and call it a song; no sir| you can tell by listening that the band put a lot of effort into their songs| spending a lot of time writing and revising until they felt everything was just right. Each song flows smoothly and no two songs sound exactly the same| as is the the problem with so many other bands these days.As you may have gathered by now| this is a great album| but at the same time it's not without its pitfalls. I did have a couple minor issues with it| but nothing that ruined the experience. For one| there are times when it feels like there's a bit too much experimentation going on| most notably in the closing song ""The Sleeper Awakens"". For the most part it's just as good as the rest of the album| but then it suddenly slows down and turns into what I believe was a weird attempt at an atmospheric black metal segment| kind of like the beginning of ""Der Rutenmarsch"" from Belphegor. I admire the open-mindedness guys| but stick to death metal| it's what you're good at. The only other issue I had was that while it is a very good album| in all honesty it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the genre. The whole time I was listening to (and enjoying) this album| I just couldn't shake the impression that it sounded like an American band doing what plenty of other European bands like Disavowed and Hour of Penance have already done. But in the end| it's still totally worth getting.Read more album reviews and news at http://moshrebellion.blogspot.com"
78,92,No| but level within the plane of existence,0.68,"Californian death metal. In the past decade we have been inundated with scores of brutal| belligerent bands who seamlessly marry the extremity of their influences with thirsty technical ability and the psycho-intellectual ardour of apocalyptic futurism. Names like Decrepit Birth| Severed Savior| Odious Mortem and The Faceless instantly come to mind| but in truth there are a large number of similar minded acts who are not necessarily attempting to reinvent the grinding wheels from which they have been spawned| but steer their vehicles of devastation through sidereal expanses of terrain that continue to entertain the willing younger generation of death metal fanatics (and rare old timers) who don't shun their explosive proficiency. Abysmal Dawn is one such act| and through their deals with Relapse and Crash Music| they have numbered themselves among the most visible in this burgeoning scene.Whether they deserve the recognition or not is up for debate. I found both of their previous albums| From Ashes and Programmed to Consume to be decent| but ultimately too easy to relegate to the pile of forgetfulness. Great cover art| fluid technical abilities and enough of the sheer brutal aesthetic to satisfy fans of their primary influences like Suffocation| Morbid Angel and Cryptopsy| but little to grasp beyond a few mere dizzying headbang sessions. They are certainly capable of whittling out appropriate| acrobatic riffs: check the :48 second mark in ""Rapture Renowned"" or the driving| melodic spike that opens ""Manufactured Humanity"". But more often than not| the brighter moments are packaged within mere functional ballast that seems to exist only to fill the space of the composition. The band is never quite so schizoid and waltzing as Odious Mortem| extraneously jazzy as The Faceless| or ominous as Decrepit Birth| but they share a lot in common with most of the California counterparts.Leveling the Plane of Existence is far from a boring album. Their jerking dynamic skills alone will guarantee that you don't doze off through the 40 minutes of material| but there are simply too few moments that manifest into something really gripping. The solos are competent but often feel like they stretch just a few seconds long into meaninglessness| and the breakdowns offer nothing more than chugging| ballistic competence. The production is polished and low end| with moments like the muted intro to ""In Service of Time"" as the control group| but at best the band pull off a few great riffs that serve them as a West Coast alternative to early Decapitated. There is certainly a market for this style| and Abysmal Dawn obviously put effort forward in the album's creation| but I found it subtly less enjoyable than their last two| and I think they've got better in them.-autothrallhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com"
79,93,Meat n potatos,0.7,"Too often modern death metal bands seem content to imitate genre originators ala Morbid Angel| Cannibal Corpse or Deicide. Hence| it is refreshing to hear a band that plays traditional death metal and somehow manages to come across as reasonably unique. And| with Obsolescence| Abysmal Dawn do just that. Sure| it's not mind blowing| it's certainly not innovative| and it's not even an awesome example of traditional death metal. Occasionally it does delve into clone territory with some sections hearkening back to Bloodbath and Immolation| as well as occasionally delving into derivative technical death metal. It is| however| a reasonably satisfying affair with lots of great chunky riffs. The song writing is proficient enough| and they occasionally come up with a real memorable song like ""Inanimate."" The band does display a bit of variety which keeps it interesting; they effortlessly go from almost Kataklysm-esque grooves to brutal blasts to mellow bits| and it's technical at times but not in an irritating or overblown way. To close the album off| there's a cover of Dissection's ""Night Blood"" which adds some melodic black metal elements in. The mix is quite good. Too often modern death metal bands amp up the drums when compared to the guitars but Abysmal Dawn rightfully keeps the guitars up in the mix. The sound is also not sterile| another of this reviewer's pet peeves in the genre. Charles Elliott does his best in showcasing that he should have been the next vocalist for Bloodbath as opposed to Nick Holmes. His voice is very much in the vein of Pete Tägtgren or Mikael Akerfeldt| and he would've fit in perfectly on Bloodbath's new one. So in the end| Obsolescence is an enjoyable if unspectacular affair. It does show signs of potential greatness. Provided all their ducks come in a row| Abysmal Dawn could be coming up with a classic of their own next time around."
80,93,If only they could perfect slavery ...,0.78,I can't believe| a year after this albums release it hasn't been reviewed.Abysmal Dawn is a technical death metal band from Los Angeles| California; probably the most unlikely of places to find good technical death metal. But there you have it. They're previous works were nice| if slightly underwhelming takes on the genre. The production values and song writing have gotten as significant boost on this album.The production| first and foremost| is just about perfect. Sharp| snappy drums| meaty but clear guitar tone and a sweet over all mix. I gotta acknowledge this drummer| because he's so free with his use of cymbals and toms| and yet it doesn't sound too chaotic or random| and always helps moves the music forward| even while standing on it's own legs.The band's sound is like good ol' US death metal got sprinkled with the technical stylings of Canada and Europe| that is to say it's not blended in| but rather pretty patchy. For example| the first two tracks are very European with slightly neo-classical riffage| and a touch of melody in the vein of the Europeans| but the next three tracks are more rhythmic| even occasionally groovy and Eastern US sounding. Come to think of it| tracks 7 and 8 have even a flair of European black metal chords.The album is over all very solid death metal| that| although is certainly pretty generic doesn't fail to get the head nodding and evoke all the proper murder instincts that death metal should. There are two standout tracks however. Easily the best track on the album is Perfecting Slavery which is hardhitting| tight| and exemplary technical death metal. It has fast| neo-classical type riffs| fantastic drumming| and all the whirlwind riffing you could ever want from a awesome technical death metal track. The other standout track is The Inevitable Return to Darkness which is the nice almost-epic closer has a truckload of riffs and opens up to some sweet melodies toward the end and breaks down nicely.Very solid release from these guys| their stock is definitely on the rise. If they continue with tracks like Perfecting Slavery| I dare say they could be in the top of their class. Absolutely check out Perfecting Slavery| it's one of the best executed technical death metal tracks in recent memory.
81,94,Horrendous rite of old school death metal,0.8,Once I stopped listening to Auroch’s “From Forgotten Worlds”| I just moved forward to another recent release from Hellthrasher| hoping that it will make a better impression on me that the disappointing album of that Canadian band. I putted on Abysme’s debut CD and maaaaaaaan| now I can say that I feel way happier and satisfied with the music on it. Again we deal with completely unknown band| this one hailing from Pittsburgh| USA| but I really can say that the style of Abysme is something way more exciting and killer for my musical taste than the cacophonous and way too complex playing of Auroch. I don’t know whether the demo from 2009 was any good| but it must have been| if it caught the attention of Bartek from Hellthrasher| who offered the deal to Abysme and quickly “Strange Rites” was released (now the LP version is announced by Blood Harvest!!!). Oh| and I just found out that Abysme features a founding member of Funerus| Brad Heiple| who’s been in this band already in the very beginning| in the early 90’s as well as on the debut full length| “Festering Earth” (I don’t know only why did he let McEntee’s to take the control over his band? Not that I’m complaining| as they do awesome job! Just listen to “Reduced to Sludge”!!!!!)I’m obviously not going to compare Abysme to Auroch| as there’s no point in it. Both bands – except the label – have absolutely nothing in common| but I can say one thing first: Abysme is way more old school and traditional sounding death metal band and for me it works in their advantage and makes their music more interesting for me than the weird and complex song structures of Auroch. Definitely the Swedish scene has made a huge impact on the Abysme music| even the guitar tone can give you this idea| but please don’t expect some simple and boring rip off of the old Swedish bands| as I think that Abysme actually managed to build something exceptionally unique on the ruins of the traditional death metal from Sweden as well as US (Autopsy| Death| Repulsion)| UK (Bolt Thrower) and Holland (Asphyx| Pestilence| Gorefest). OK| they (Abysme) may not be discovering the new planets| but definitely| maybe due to the fact that it seems like Abysme is not influenced directly just by one band only| but a wider range of classic acts| they make an impression to be different that most of the current old styled death metal bands. The most obvious influence for Abysme would probably be Entombed| whose “Left Hand Path” must have made a huge impact on the creators of “Strange Rites”. Another one| which I must point out| is Dismember and their debut album of corpse. Traces of these cult and influential LPs you can spot in many parts of Abysme’s music| take a listen to “Formless” for instance and I guess the opening fragment of it will be enough to convince you. But then there are some faster tunes also| which will break your neck in the good old Repulsion way (“Beyond the Seventh Door”) and on top of that you’ll get hit by some slower bits as well. I especially liked “Annihilated Memory”| where the opening slow riff is just a masterpiece| reminding me the good old Asphyx| but the whole song also has some faster and more relentless pieces| so in the end it is just a killer dose of death metal music. From the other hand if you’ll survive the ferocity of “Beyond the Seventh Door” then you may discover how memorable so many riffs from this album are. It could probably have been even more catchy| if such a big part of “Strange Rites” wasn’t focusing on the fast| neckbreaking songs like the one I just mentioned or “Fallen Colossus”. Hmm| actually if I’m going to be honest – and I always am in my reviews – then I would say that my only minor complain for Abysme would be the fact that I liked those slower or mid tempo parts more| while the fast ones tend to bore me a little| as they all sound always the same. But that definitely do not spoil the impression for the whole album so much.One of the most noticeable tracks off the “Strange Rites” is definitely the closing one| “Remarkable Conqueror”| which will nail you down with this long| monumental doomy part| which Abysme plays in the end and definitely this sounds like the most proper way to finish such an excellent album – with the sounds of the doom or apocalypse| which announces coming of the end. Well| the wall of slow| massive riffs is something what only pushes to play the whole album again and I do so without a hesitation. Besides| the whole album is just about 35 minutes on the clock| so there’s no room for boredom| but plenty of rotten energy and lethal| cutting riffage. Ha| check out also the artwork on the album| with this terrifying rite of great Lovecraftian creature| which rips and devours people| who perform an orgy of sex and murder (decapitated people| butchered babies… anything you want!).Anyway| this definitely is an album| to which I’ll be coming back more often. There will be a vinyl version available through the mighty Blood Harvest| so stay tuned and join the strange| horrendous rite of this Pittsburgh trio.Standout tracks: “Remarkable Conqueror”| “Formless”| “Annihilated Memory”
82,94,Like an everflowing stream of brutality,0.9,"Pennsylvania's Abysme clearly have no problem wearing their influences on their tattered sleeves. With a very clear influence from Swedish death metal| Abysme worship at the altar of Dismember| Apshyx| and take cues from acts like Immolation and Pungent Stench. ""Strange Rites"" is a trite and devout offering to the gods of ultra-distorted guitars| fuzzy bass| and throat ripping vocals. With influences like this| it would seem Abysme have taken an already used formula and do not have a unique sound of their own. But in a way| they most definitely do. Overall| all the traits of pure death metal mixed with the sound and style of Swedish death metal are ultimately what make this album great. While most death metal acts are attempting to out blast each other| or hold competitions of who can sound most like an injured pig| Abysme slow the tempo down| making the eerie more eerie and the aggressive more aggressive. While the guitar style does not change throughout| the riffs do not get tired. With a healthy mix of beefy power chords and striking tremolo picking| the albums timing and precision make it lightyears ahead of what other USDM acts are giving out nowadays. Dismember's influence stands clear throughout the whole album| but it is more of an appreciation than a full on tribute. Taking this slow| daunting death metal sound and mixing it with a doomy sludge aesthetic| Abysme lean to the dark side of metal all throughout this album. While the influences are what make the band sound how it is| the overall mood of the album is more planted in a blackened thrash metal aura than anything else. While they do make straight forward death metal| Abysme take the production mostly used on a black metal album and use it to make something essentially evil. Not once does the album wane| either. The straight-for-your-throat style is what make this album extreme| and yet does not impose itself on you either. In all| Abysme seem to know what sound they want| and stick with it all the way through. Most will dispel them as a Dismember tribute band| or one who would rather sound like a legendary act of the past than find a sound that is for themselves. To those naysayers I say this| the band has a slight edge to a formula used by countless others. Dark| moody| and overall doom laden this album is a perfect precursor for what just may be the beginning of an underground band's rise to infamy. As a whole| this is what death metal should be| and Abysme are certainly aware of that.[Also posted to rimeoftheancientmetallers.blogspot.com]"
83,101,Obituary revisited with malice,0.83,Obituary-esque bands are rare. Of the top of my mind| I can only recall Viogression coming close to that band’s initial glory. There were others like Six Feet Under that tried to recreate some of that magic but met with only partial success| that too on the first album or so. Even though there were bands influenced by that Celtic Frost-discharged death metal sound| hardly anyone could compete with John Tardy’s vocal delivery and the simplistic but supremely effective riffing| especially those haunting solos. None of them really left a mark nor did anything significant with that sound. Meanwhile| Obituary started rapping and it went downhill from there. The comeback material was inspiring but it can’t hold a candle to the band’s first two albums.But the moment I first heard Abyssus| especially the Greek band’s split/EP material| I was utterly impressed. It had that ‘Slowly We Rot’ vibe which I thought was impossible to create since. After that one| I found solace in grindcore albums but hardly any death metal ones – the hurricane-like intensity was unmatched. ‘Slowly We Rot’ became not only my favourite Obituary album| but it also still ranks as one of my all-time favourite death metal albums. The early Abyssus material sounds astonishingly close to that| and even their vocalist sounds uncannily similar to John Tardy from that era. I couldn’t believe how effective the music was| taking the best elements of Obituary if you will and compounding it with the old school aesthetics of say Death| Asphyx and Unleashed. If you call yourself a death metal fan| you’ve got to revel in music of this ilk. I particularly loved the upbeat crust leanings that the band seemed to portray on that material.Memento Mori signed up the band for a debut full length release| which came to be called ‘Into the Abyss’. It sounds closer to Obituary‘s ‘Cause of Death’ album than ‘Slowly We Rot’. It means Abyssus sound more mature with better songwriting| even though it comes at the expense of toning down the raw energy| that pure adrenaline rush. I guess you can’t have your cake and eat it too. But there are more fans of ‘Cause of Death’ era than ‘Slowly We Rot’ and with good reason. ‘Into the Abyss’ is a very worthy attempt at sounding in that vein| but the band also make sure to combine pure influences of other bands| most notably of early Asphyx and Unleashed| and the whole album is brimming with that raw yet distilled proto-death metal appeal. The songs are caustic| brisk and offer more variations than the ones that were peddling in the style a couple of decades back. The relevance is here and it’s refreshing| especially considering that it’s not been done often in this style| not then| not now.The drumming is quite upbeat which gives the music that aggression and drive missing in several old school sounding bands. Abyssus possess a vicious edge| one that’s not synthesized from modern production values. The thing can still poison you easily with its toxicity| and that rawness| that vigour brings to mind onslaughts of Swedish death metal bands like Dismember and Vermin. There’s fierce tension that’s maintained here| as Abyssus trudge| march| and stomp through the cesspool of modern excesses. My only gripe is that the presence of leads is minimal here and old school death metal doesn’t sound the same without it. Nonetheless| the consistency is maintained throughout and Abyssus prove to be lethal in their expression.‘Into the Abyss’ is a superbly tempered old school death metal album that’s sufficiently nostalgic as well as packs in a powerful dose of grating brutality.Written for Transcending Obscurity webzine - www.tometal.com
84,107,Feels great to listen to it again!,0.9,I am and I think I always have been a big fan of the Dutch death metal| with such bands as Asphyx| Gorefest| God Dethroned| Thanatos| Excavation| Delirium| Sinister| Mystic Charm| Pestilence| Beyond Belief| Acrostichon| Eternal Solstice plus few more| which I probably forgot now. This country had unique| heavy feeling when speaking of the sound and style of the bands from Holland and that is why so many of them really were my favourites – and still are| as they are just immortal classics for me. Anyway| here I am going to review another classic album – Acrostichon’s “Engraved In Black”. Well| Acrostichon for sure is one of those bands| which I got to know quite early| as I used to have a cassette version of this album in the mid 90’s| I think it was released by Lout Out| but I am not 100% sure now. I lost this cassette years ago. Recently I’ve noticed that Memento Mori from Spain is going to re-issue this album on CD| with some demo songs as bonus… and wow| just as many similar reissues it quickly ended up on my shipping list. Somehow though I was postponing the purchase| until one day I saw that Doomentia Records from Czech Republic plans to release a vinyl version of “Engraved In Black”. And let’s be honest – to have this record on vinyl became a quick priority for me| as such classics are best to have on this format. More so| Doomentia planned to issue “Engraved In Black” in very special way… and well| now I hold this piece of vinyl in my hands and I can say that The Crypt Records| which used to release the best pieces of vinyl records in recent years| now has a strong competitor| as Doomentia did just absolutely fuckin perfect and damn excellent work with “Engraved In Black”. Holding this album in hands is just something fantastic. The whole album is housed in heavy and thick cardboard gatefold cover| which trust me is very impressive. Then you open it and see the title: Acrostichon - “Engraved In Black” (Twentieth anniversary edition)… there’s 24 pages booklet glued to the gatefold| so you turn the page and there are some comments from the musicians of Acrostichon and from Paul Speckmann. Cool! And then going through rest of the pages – there are many archive photos| all the lyrics for the album| with each song having a comment| which is something really cool| as this way you can know something more about the whole album| like for example the fact that “Immolation of the Agnostic” was the very first song written by Richard Schouten for Acrostichon (it also opened most of the gigs| which Acrostichon played). Finally there are few graphics in this booklet… and trust me| everyting really does look amazing. The layout| graphics| font| which they used – everything looks absolutely damn impressive. For this and Memento Mori’s issue of “Engraved In Black” Acrostichon changed the front cover – and I usually moan that I don’t like when bands change the covers when they re-release their albums| as I think that the artwork is also an essential part of the music. They’ve changed the cover here| because – as Richard Schouten wrote – he simply wasn’t happy with the original artwork. And yeah| I definitely agree that this new drawing he did for “Engraved In Black” looks better and actually is damn scary hehe| but I would like to see the original cover used somewhere in the middle of the booklet as well (just like Centinex did for their “Subconscious Lobotomy” reissue – they had new front cover| but the old one has been shown in the booklet). So| it is a bit shame they haven’t reminded us the original artwork| especially that it wasn’t so bad| really… Luckily this new front cover looks great and vinyl edition of “Engraved In Black” contains a huge poster with it. So| the whole vinyl| with its heavy 350 grams cover and booklet looks astonishing. This vinyl is not cheap| but it is worth all money you’ll spend on it. Doomentia did excellent job| in my opinion… and if I had something to moan about then maybe the fact that “Engraved In Black” vinyl edition hasn’t got any Acrostichon demos as bonus (all in all they appeared on the CD version). I actually hoped that there will be a two LP set| with a couple of demos and EPs on the second record as a bonus… Sadly| they haven’t done that| so maybe one day they’ll issue a separate vinyl edition with Acrostichon demos for the collectors? It would be cool.OK| finally so I have this long sought after vinyl edition of “Engraved In Black”… time to write something about the music| right? Well| Acrostichon is a classic representative of Dutch death metal – and Dutchs were all mainly about the atmosphere| about the heavy| massive death metal| with a lot of doomy parts| but with some more grinding moments here and there. And “Engraved In Black” is a classic example of this style. From the beginning it will certainly remind you such bands as Asphyx| early Gorefest| Mystic Charm and “Consuming Impulse” era Pestilence. On top of these bands| I would mention some American acts| such as Master| Derketa and Mythic – and obviously also Autopsy (so bands| which also had a strong doom influence in their music) and finally in few moments I can also smell a Swedish odour! Think of all these bands| listen to such songs as the mentioned before “Immolation of the Agnostic” and you’ll instantly recognize what do I mean. This song alone has really a strong bond to what Asphyx used to do. There really is a great| slow| doomy| dark and obscure riff| great heavy and massive part| which will crush your bones and flesh into one disgusting and stinking pile of carcass. Unlike Asphyx I think that Acrostichon more often used faster parts| so the music is more dynamic| with a lot of variety between all the songs and is also more brutal| especially with Corinne’s vocals| which are just unearthly (maybe they could have been better| but that woman seriously sounds angry and furious). But seriously| “Engraved In Black” is just a prime old school death metal. I worship such music| with its obscure and dark atmosphere| killer feeling (something all these modern death metal albums are completely lacking)| really good| but still slightly raw production (here by Colin Richardson!)… It is priceless for me| to have such albums and listen to them. The time flies| it has already been almost 20 years since I have listened to “Engraved In Black” for the first time| but I still find this LP as something utterly refreshing and I am very enthusiastic to listen to it.Standout tracks: “Immolation of the Agnostic”| “Lost Remembrance”| “Relics”| “Engraved In Black”Final rate: 90/100
85,107,A forgotten Dutch death metal gem,0.95,One of the most funny things I recall from those days was that vocalist Corine said in an interview that she disliked the Gorefest debut (Mindloss) only having one new song. When Acrostichon’s “ Engraved In Black” finally came out it also featured…. One new song. And that was “Zombies”. A great song by the way. A lyrical tribute to old horror movies and musically inspired by the likes of Autopsy and Coroner with a touch of hardcore punk backing vocals.The production (Colin Richardson) was a lot sharper than their demos were. The guitars still sounded heavy but they had so much more definition. And of course the drums sounded more mature. Bass and vocals? Just as good as always really. The rest of the album consists of material that was written from 1987 to 1991. So a lot of diversity was to be expected. We have ancient songs like “Havoc” and “Mentally Deficient” which are relatively shorter songs and more straight forward than the newer material. Especially the catchiness and rhythms of “Mentally Deficient” are memorable.Then there are the most catchy songs from their “Dehumanized” demo| namely “Dehymanized”and “Lost Remembrance”. I still wonder why the epic “Thriving On Chaos” was not included since that song had proved to be a live favorite. Still| “Dehymanized”and “Lost Remembrance” were the most brutal (and as said| catchy) songs from that demo| so no complaints here. Opener “Immolation Of The Agnostic” came from the first ever demo “Prologue” and with this production is becomes clear how good and well crafted this song actually is. It goes through all tempi and dynamics Acrotichon were know for yet still remaining a strong and coherent composition. Truly a classic Acrostichon song!The remaining three songs (“Walker Of Worlds”| “Relics” and “Engraved in Black”) are all around the 6 minute mark and combine the intensity of their shorter songs with the earlier mentioned more epic and elaborate “Immolation Of The Agnostic ”. These three songs came from their earlier 1991 live tape (on which relics was still called “Germinant Malefaction”) and with this production they sound even better (the cymbals on that demo were quite annoying). “Walker Of Worlds” has some amazing speed but it becomes obvious blast speed drums are not Serge Smolders’ favorite thing to do (well maybe they are but he sounds better and more convincing when playing D-beat or doom).“Relics” has also appeared earlier on a Peaceville sampler and that version was slightly more enjoyable because of the longer intro and the production (which lay soundwise between this album and their Dehumanized demo). Also the version of “Mentally Deficient” which had appeared on the D.S.F.A. 3 sampler was slightly better than this version (again| because of the production)So even if the production was not their best| it surely was better than their earlier demos. Acrostichon sounded more dynamic than other Dutch death metal bands in that period. The balance between ultra doom| speed and even some groove gave them their own specific sound. Not forgetting to mention Corine’s vocals. So deep| so dirty! Guitarist Richard Schouten was the main songwriter for the band and surely gave the world some marvellous death metal classics! The other guitarist Jos had the hots for classic metal and it showed! His solo’s were high standard for death metal criteria. Try to imagine combining Autopsy with Nihilist but with a more in your face production and throw in some extra Black Sabbath and a few hints of ancient thrash. Acrostichon had character!Too bad it took them a few years before finally releasing their debut album. If they'd done that 2 years earlier| they might have become a lot bigger than they did in the end. By the way: the artwork sucks. But their artwork always sucked.
86,108,Some excellent songs yet something was missing...,0.8,The biggest problem with Sentenced is very simple. The drum production. A lot of these songs had been played a while live and I also got some of them on a live vhs from those days. When Sentenced finally came out the production really damaged the the dynamics of those songs. And dynamics were something very important to the Acrostichon sound.Songs like “Shelter” and especially “Snapshot” represented the faster and more aggressive side of Acrostichon. “Snapshot” even had some typical thrash metal riffing emphasizing the speed. The songs “Forgotten” and “Victims” are the best songs here. Both around 5 minues and filled with changes in pace and key. They were typical Acrostichon compositions but the variation of the vocals this time were a slight step forward.Now two other new songs (“Murder” and “Monsters”) were also recorded but ended up on their earlier “Forgotten” EP. One wonders why did not make the album since they would easily have been two of the better songs! (“Murder” balancing between Snapshot and Shelter and “Monsters” being a very ‘happy’ and catchy death metal tune paying tribute to horror movies). If someone ever decides to re-release this album| do include these songs as bonus tracks.As said there is a slight progress on this album. Corine’s vocals aren’t always just deep and low anymore (don't worry| she doesn't really 'sing'). This really does wonders on some songs and makes their sound even more varied. Secondly guitarist Richard Schouten had been replaced by Michel Meeuwissen who played slightly thrashier than his predecessor.But in the end it is really the dated digital drum production that is killing the metal attitude of this album. The drums are triggered and the samples are far from adequate. One wonders if drummer Serge agreed to this since normally he is such a briliant live musician (as he shows these days with for instance the crossover band Milkman). “Sentenced” is pretty good but could have been so much better!
87,109,mind numbingly monotonous...,0.4,In retrospect| I may have been a little over zealous in my comments about Act of Gods 2003 four track ep ‘Dies Irae’. Maybe my penchant for blasting death metal has changed over the past year| I’m not sure| but I know I was expecting a little more than what has been achieved on the bands new full length ‘Stench of Centuries’.Act of Gods (who feature two members from French deathsters ‘Mutilated’) were signed to the Osmose stable of the strength of their ‘DI’ demo and from what I heard on that short| but furious 12 minute disc| they threatened to step another cog and deliver a death metal monster with ‘SOC’. Unfortunately| this doesn’t appear to be the case. Not to these ears anyway. There is no questioning of AOG ability to pen straight ahead| old school death metal - this is as enraged and blasting as anything they put forth on the EP| yet it is strangely devoid of anything exciting or musically challenging.The problem with Act of Gods and more specifically their songwriting is their utter lack of variation. SOC is an 11-track affair (12 if you get the vinyl) and clocks in at the 50-minute mark. Now| with a musical style that limits itself to guttural dog vomit vocals and an incessant reliance on blast beats ad nausem| SOC is extremely testing on the patience. Even the most dedicated brutal DM fan would be a stretch to sit through this. The old school Morbid Angel meets Deicide vibe is commendable and all| but there is simply nothing here that distinguishes each track from the next. Drop the needle (or laser) anywhere on this disc and try to name a track. You can’t do it. Act of Gods can play like bastards| but when it comes to writing a memorable riff or altering their style just a tad| they are simply bereft of ideas.The production of ‘SOC’ is probably one of its saving graces. Stephane Buriez (of LOUDBLAST) has permitted AOG to forge a raw old school style production that allows their ferocity shine through (as much as it can anyway). The guitar sound could be a little cleaner and powerful in the mix| but overall it probably suits what they were trying to achieve here.Act of Gods are for seriously deranged underground Death Metal fanatics that have nothing better to do with their time than to listen to 50 minutes of blast beats without variation or ideas. If that’s you| then this is probably your album of the year. For the rest of us who want variation and song writing smarts in their Death Metal| this must be avoided at all costs.
88,110,Photonic Obliteration,0.7,There is a clear distinction between bands playing brutal death metal and those doing the technical aspects of it. Bands that attempt to do both have to be either very brave| very stupid or just downright clever. Act Of Gods may not be the best death metallers out there| but they are certainly clever enough to pull off technical guitar gymnastics but also bludgeon you as an added bonus. If you take the guitar wizardry of Hate Eternal or Decapitated and add the Krisiun style mechanical battering then you have more or less got Act of Gods. They use their influences to good effect| with Morbid Angel (as usual)| Pestilence and later Death material being a feature throughout this concept album about quantum physics. Thankfully the music is no where near as tedious as the topic of quantum physics. The album’s high end production gives it a refreshing razor sharp guitar sound that is atypical from the usual down-tuned muddiness| and a plucky bass that is reminiscent of Pestilence material| particularly in the slower phases. Each song has a central core riff that is then swarmed over by peripheral riffs and multiple time changes to keep you on your toes. Complexity in death metal is a dangerous beast to tame and can easily lead to a lack of control if left without its reins. There are hints that some of the songs are indeed spiralling out of control but AOG pull on those reins and introduce some melodic touches not too far from straight heavy metal| as on “Ghost of Ophidius”. Ventylator’s vocal work varies from grunts| growls and snarls and this is not a criticism as too many death metal growlers try too hard and making them sound forced and strained| whereas Ventylator’s voice changes with ease. The making of any death metal album to these ears is the drum work| and Guillaume showcases his drum acrobatics to great effect. The sound comes across as being a little thin| due to the high end production mentioned previously| but Guillaume’s Krisiun style assault suits the driving and incisive guitar work very well. The standout track “Inside the Hypersphere” should have been the closer instead of the title track as “MAAT” is too chaotic and comes across as a showcase for each band member to demonstrate their prowess. As an added bonus there’s a live video for Cathedral of Flesh which is a typical but enjoyable affair. It is unfortunate to end negatively as AOG pay tribute to Terrorizer by covering “After World Obliteration”. Their version is competent enough and stays true to the formula of the original and is thereby a pointless exercise. Apart from this moan| this is a quality release that can more than match most technical death metal out there.
89,113,Terrific Death Metal from France,0.9,For whatever reason| time usually being the main one| I sometimes let reviews slip through the cracks. By that I mean that I fully intended to write one| have listened to the album and whatnot| yet I didn’t get around to it as soon as I would have liked. That is the case with Ad Patres ferocious album| Scorn Aesthetics| which was released by Kaotoxin Records back in February. This is a further confounded by the fact that the French label has yet to release anything that I have not liked. Ah well| better late than never| right?Onto the case in hand and that being Scorn Aesthetics which is| aside from being a great name for an album| a monstrous slab of death metal. The band itself was created by Alsvid| who you may know from French black metal exponents| Seth| and Scorn Aesthetics is their debut album| after having release an EP and split album. And it’s a beast.What Ad Patres have delivered on this album is an almost claustrophobic sense of being smothered by the sheer weight of the music. A short intro| entitled … launches straight into The Lock| and its deep throaty death metal vocals| tight riffing and blistering drumming all the way into the darkness.The pace of Scorn Aesthetics is a fairly brisk one| with the entire album running to about 30 minutes or so| but that’s not to say that Ad Patres don’t mix it up. Sure| the drumming thunders along| most of the time| but such is the musicianship and songwriting that nothing sounds repetitive. By the time you reach the punch of In Vivo you’ll have been given a good solid beating| and you’ll still have three more tracks to go!Fortunately| the production here is pretty damned good| so even though the music smothers you| throws you in a sack and beats you around the head| everything sounds great in the mix. No one element overpowers another| with each musician being given ample room to flex their muscles| allowing the songs to shine.Scorn Aesthetics delivers the more brutal and| dare I say| old school approach to intensely fast technical death metal. However| aside from the more intricate parts there is plenty of room for good old-fashioned heavy-as-hell riffing. It’s all very good and definitely needs to be played loud!If you haven’t had the chance to check out Ad Patres yet| this is the perfect opportunity as this is a killer album. Fast| heavy as fuck and totally unforgiving.
90,113,Vintage Approach| Yet Refreshingly Contemporary,0.85,"Among the legions of death metal bands in today's day and age| very few manage to capture the essence of the genre's roots and reinvigorate them into a fresh and vigorously modern sound. Death metal has progressed throughout the years into a multitude of various sub-genres with a wide array of different extremes| approaches| and flavors of exotic themes| playing styles| and presentations. Few bands have managed to stay true to the genre's classic sound without being considered a tribute to the ""old school"" or persuasive enough to trademark the simplicity of death metal's original structure as a modernized architecture rather than a base foundation. However| one band has proven themselves exceptionally talented at revitalizing the genre's core elements and presenting them in a way that is not only modern| but surpasses the efforts of the more experimental and technical efforts of today's contemporaries.Ad Patres are a young French band that knows their roots all too well and has mastered themselves into purveyors of crushing brutality. Founded in late 2008 and after releasing a demo and being featured on a split with U.S. death band Writhing| Ad Patres unleashed Scorn Aesthetics| their full-length debut in late 2012. Scorn Aesthetics captures a band in peak form with an arsenal of top-shelf death metal compositions. Packed with the ferocity of rapid-fire artillery| the album clocks in just over the thirty-minute mark with not one second wasted. Scorn Aesthetics is a loaded cannon of punchy guitar riffs| blast beat percussion| breakdowns and exceptional death vocals with the power to devastate far and wide. Hordes of fans are sure to appreciate the band's capabilities as well as find a comforting simplicity in their approach.Although Scorn Aesthetics is Ad Patres' debut| the band presents themselves as a fluid| well-rounded group with an album that is as adhesive as it is memorable. There is a very nice quality of thickness and balance within the record's mix| and each song is compellingly forged. Every song on Scorn Aesthetics is worthy of honorable mention; however| a few highlights include: ""Scars Of Compromise""| and ""Anti"". While the approach to crafting their music is nothing new| it is the sum of their parts that make Ad Patres such a special band that stands above the rest. One could compare the band's sound to the likes of Sinister| Krisiun and Decapitated and while the former are all well-established acts| it is only their age that separates them from Ad Patres.There is no debating Ad Patres is an excellent band with no place to go but up. Undeniably| Scorn Aesthetics is a valid and exceptionally crafted work. In the ever changing| rapidly evolving world of extreme metal| Ad Patres have offered up an album firmly rooted| however| of its own species. The band is hauntingly familiar| yet blasts of unique freshness. It will be interesting to see how this band evolves. No doubt| they are a very talented bunch you can expect to (thankfully) hear a lot more from. For now| Scorn Aesthetics is a perfect debut sure to please the masses. Fans of the more technical| avant-garde and experimental new waves of extreme metal may sadly overlook this release| but they will be few and unfortunately missing out on what may be one of the better albums in recent times.***Originally written for and by www.deathportal.net"
91,113,Generic But Decent Death Metal,0.67,"When I was in Tilburg to play Mario's Metal Meeting I remember hearing from other bands and people at the show that individuals in the Netherlands were very critical of musical technicality. At the time| I remember that making total sense because thinking of bands like Iniquity and Sinister I figured that interest in technical prowess would translate to other metal genres as well - in my case Traditional Metal. Let me just say that France's Ad Patres would go over quite well in that country judging on their expert musicianship which is by far the band's best attribute on their debut release Scorn Aesthetics. They are but one of many Death Metal bands of the style in the nation of late and Death Metal seems to be a huge trend in France while in many other countries it seems the genre has been dropping in popularity. Maybe my observation is wrong but Ad Patres is just another one of these Death Metal projects from France which will get little attention outside of the country.The artwork on the album is a blur of reds and blacks and is geared to appeal to no one except those that would want another album in the collection with a disjointed cover featuring a skull| conjoined bodies| a hung human peering out of a window and some lovely smelling incense to hopefully mask what must be a god-awful odor in that tiny five inch square room that is the album cover. The rest of the album's inner sleeves follow in kind except for the band photo which is in black and white. The quintet could either be Ad Patres or a photoshopped picture of a college biology class during a black out. The rest of the booklet has the lyrics which I have no interest in reading because the vocals on the album are about as dull as death metal vocals can get and I would have no desire to scream them out with vocalist Axel Doussaud. Either way| a quick glance at songs like ""The Lock"" reveal lyrics that probably weren't worth being printed; ""I will dig your fucking grave| I will kill you with my own hands."" Blah Blah... it's the same crap that the Jamaican dude I work with comes up with to stereotypically mock Heavy Metal as a whole. Musically| the album contains two halves split by the dying patience of myself. While the album starts strong with ""The Lock""| ""Scars of Compromise"" and ""To The Fathers|"" afterwards the album teeters off. It's not that the songs are any different - they're not - but all the band's creativity is available on display early on and the backside of the album leaves little surprises and engagement. The whole album sounds like a combination of Krisiun with some slowed spots - the more interesting moments - taking cues from Decapitated's Organic Hallucinosis. Leads appear on several tracks and rekindle memories of listening to Necrophagist though here| the leads are much more interesting since they aren't fighting tooth and nail within a song that was essentially just one long guitar fracas to begin with. Best track for me though is ""Scars of Compromise|"" which contains a refreshing interlude about halfway into the song that cuts the blasting and blabbering genericism down a notch with some drawn out atonality and mixed drum beats. The problem with a lot of the tracks here though is that they don't actually seem to go anywhere and come off as a collection of cool - and not so cool - tremolo riffs with mundane blast beats beneath. At this stage in the game it just doesn't interest me that much but I'd tell everyone who just can't get enough death metal that they wouldn't have to work hard to head bang to Scorn Aesthetics.

92,113,Frenetic Francoblasting brutality,0.75,"It might not be the most impressive death metal I've heard in recent months| but Ad Patres' full-length debut Scorn Aesthetics is sure to place the French newcomers square on the radar of a wide cross-berth of genre fans due to its level of polish and flexibility. Combining traits of their defunct countrymen Yyrkoon with the thrust of Polish pummelers like Behemoth and Hate| the surgical aptitude of early Pestilence or their Dutch peers Sinister| and a bevy of brutal| old school tremolo picking sequences that careen and collide throughout the album's clinical| pervasive darkness| there's something here that just about any morgue employee can grasp onto| and the performances are razor sharp even if the band's overall sound isn't the most distinct.The guitar tone used here is very crisp| trading potential muscle for rapid fire penetration and emaciated savagery redolent of the first Pestilence record| Mallevs Maleficavm if it were saturated in the more contemporary riffing structures of| say| the latest Suffocation album. The riffs aren't intensely memorable or original| but they're constantly flying at an accelerated clip and shifting from muted transitions to harried grooves. What's more| the Frenchmen create excellent lead bridge sequences which amplify the mood and atmosphere of each track| the leads dowsed in just enough reverb and effects to chill the listener amidst the more busied but less frightening verses and breakdowns. The drums here are totally on point| the feet just as fast as the hands for the varied blast and double bass sequences| and loads of fills being fired off at available opportunities without cluttering the composition. I didn't pick up a ton of bass guitar in the mix| but if you pay closer attention you can hear that the guy is just as acrobatic as the guitarists| even if his lines don't really veer away from the primary patterns.Vocals are a pretty standard grunt circa Glen Benton| David Vincent and Frank Mullen; nothing outstanding| but dynamic and fast enough to match the musical endeavor.The mix is also well suited to the writing: you can really pick out the percussive nature of the guitars| which often create a thrashing texture. It was interesting to read that a few of the members have experience with the black metal group Seth| at least the drummer| whose incredible persistence certainly could carry over form that field. Song quality was consistent throughout the 32+ minutes| with a few like ""Emphasize Nihility"" and ""Scars of Compromise"" mildly catchier than others| but overall I did feel there was some sameness and redundancy involved| if not for actual patterns of repetition then just similar structures in several of the riffs. They're not the catchiest band| but if you give yourself over to their unapologetic manhandling| you're sure to come away from this impressed. The French have long had a great scene for this style| and while Ad Patres might not feel so 'progressive' as Carcariass or Gorod| or as brutal and brawl-worthy as Benighted| they have delivered here a solid and sadistic introduction to their manic violence.-autothrallhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com"
93,113,Solid But Unspectacular,0.59,In 2010| esteemed French black metal drummer Alsvid (ex-Seth| | Enthroned) assembled a group to indulge his love of precise| technical death metal| and following a Mathieu Pascal (Gorod) produced demo recording and an appearance at the mighty Hellfest| ‘Scorn Aesthetics’| their debut full-length| represents the full fruits of their labour. After a brief and fairly forgettable atmospheric intro| ‘The Lock’ rages into view like a tight| well-oiled killing machine| spewing out early Decapitated style fretboard acrobatics left| right and centre. Indeed| the influence of records like ‘Winds Of Creation’ and ‘Nihility’ is evident throughout this album| with the syncopated chugging of ‘To The Fathers’ and the aptly titled ‘Emphasize Nihility’ following firmly in the footsteps of the Polish legends. Alsvid’s precision drumming is a highlight| with a tight| crisp snare sound that manages to escape the sterile sound that has a tendency to neuter a lot of modern death metal (although unfortunately| the same can’t be said for his overly mechanical sounding kickdrums). The guitars have a very crunchy| clinical tone; anyone expecting thick| sweaty| Entombed-style beefiness will be disappointed| but they definitely do the technical riffs justice| emphasising the intricacies of many of the more complex passages here. There are even some shimmering| melodic leads thrown in for good measure too. The bass is largely drowned out in the mix| aside from the gloriously sinister spider-like bass work that creeps in towards the end of ‘Circles Of Red’. The bassist evidently has some chops on him| so it seems a little odd that these weren’t utilised more often. Despite sounding a tad generic| newcomer Alex Doussaud puts in a fine vocal performance| with a number of very strong gurgles and lower register ferocity that suits the band well.Whilst the band sound exceptionally tight| especially as this is only their first full-length| it also seems like they are yet to fully find their own voice| with nothing in particular to distinguish them from the hordes of like-minded death bands currently doing the rounds. That said| they have enough decent riffs under their belts to ensure that this doesn’t turn into a sterile snoozefest| and the handful of interesting ideas the band uses don’t hurt either. ‘Scars Of Compromise’ and ‘To The Fathers’ both utilise some pretty intriguing melodic variations| and the title track has a kind of darkly regal feel| reminiscent of Hate Eternal’s menacing onslaught| but for the most part this is fairly standard stuff. Despite its forthcomings| this is still a pretty damn solid modern death metal album. If you find yourself a little disappointed with Decapitated’s continued transformation into a kind of Meshuggah-lite| then these guys could well be the band you’re looking for| but if you’re turned off by some of the more mechanical characteristics of contemporary tech-death then this probably won’t do much to change your mind.

94,118,An old Finnish Legend,0.9,Ah| Finland! A land of great woodlands and snow-covered mountains with happy little reindeer running about! At one point in time during the 1990’s| this country put out some Death Metal bands that have aged like a fine wine over time. Finnish Death Metal bands like Demilich| Demigod| Depravity and Convulse have seen a resurgence in popularity in the contemporary Metal community. Now even people at the American Nihilist Underground Society (ANUS) hail their transcendence from Death Metal to something more technical and furthermore a purer form of the genre. Adramelech is the band that gained the inhuman drumming skills behind Demigod’s milestone album “Slumber of Sullen Eyes”| Seppo Tattila| who picked up the guitar for Adramelech during “Psychostasia” in 1996 with drums and vocals provided by Jarkko Rantanen| who would later split off from Adramelech to play live drums and vocals for Demigod in 1998. If you are completely confused by what I just said| fret not| that’s only normal. Adramelech does not sound so much like Demigod but they are very familiar to Demilich but if the vocals were still somewhat human and there was a lot more melody. There is still a lot of technical slamming going on that really encompasses the richness of the Finnish Death Metal sound during the 90’s. “Psychostasia” is a forgotten about album that is long-overdue for the spotlight.This reissue from Xtreem Music included 3 bonus tracks of Adramelech performing “Heroes in Godly Blaze” live as well as “Seven” and “The Sleep of Ishtar”| which both appeared on their 1998 EP “Seven”.There’s really nothing to criticize about this album| being as this album is more of a polished up artifact than something new being offered. It is certainly a lot easier to comprehend than “Nespithe” because “Psychostasia” is nowhere near how bizarre that record was. But I would say this album is more of a treat for Demigod fans than Demilich fans but really this reissue is a true gift unto all Death Metal fans.(originally published on Metal-Temple.com| 3-17-2014)
95,118,35 Minutes of sheer bad-assery.,0.92,"I've quite often seen this band compared to fellow countrymen Demilich| which I could never decide if I fully agreed with. I won't deny there are some similarities but I've always felt Adramelech offered something quite different from their counterparts| and in fact the majority of their regional scene. Sure| I'm not contesting the brilliance of Demigod etc| but next to Sentenced these were probably my favorite old school death metal act from Finland.I often find it hard to place a finger on just what it is about Psychostasia that makes me love it so much. I don't normally have a lot of time for death metal| however when the time arises this is exactly the kind of shit I want to hear. The fucking riffs on this album are ingenious| perfectly technical yet always remaining damn heavy| skull splitting in fact. The vocals are awesome| with quite a muddy| suffocating mix giving them an distant| almost ethereal feel. Far from the average cookie monster growls| the vocals here had more in common with the European guard.As I stated| the production has quite a suffocating feel| yet the clarity is surprisingly good. The drums have an earthy| natural feel to them| the guitar tone is as menacing as they come and the bass just fucking rumbles around| shaking your bowels. This all adds to the dust clogged atmosphere| helped by the awesome album artwork. I wouldn't be surprised if I went out for a spot of grave robbing| only to pry open a tomb and have this album blast out in a cloud of virulent| age old debris.Blending absolutely classic old school death metal stylings such as ""The Book of the Worm"" with furious bouts of technical mastery as seen in the title track| Psychostasia is just under 35 minutes of sheer bad-assery. Whilst quite hard to track down on hard copy| this is an album I'd recommend doing anything in your power to hear. Somewhat of a lost gem amongst the mighty old school Finnish death metal scene| I can happily recommend this to any serious fan of old school death metal. This is death metal how it should be and would certainly make my top 10-20 list in the genre. BFA (bad-fucking-ass)"
96,118,A Brutal Nespithe,0.97,If there is one bad thing about underground music scenes| it's that it's possible for absolute gems to fall through the cracks. The early to mid-90's death metal scene sadly was one which misplaced a lot of great music| and Adramelech's stunning debut could be the biggest loss of the lot. Psychostasia is dripping with originality| passion and vision. Every minute of this album is filled with an unmatched style of strange yet uncompromising riffing and a unique and instantly memorable sense of obscure melody. It fuses the awkward| alien riffing style of Demilich's legendary debut Nespithe with a healthy dose of vitriolic and vicious traditional Finish death metal. The resulting combination delivers the best of both worlds| making Psychostasia an album suited for any death metal fan.One of the keys to Psychostasia being so interesting is that it has two distinct styles. One which is the odd Demilich inspired strangeness| quite a bit more aggressive in fashion| but missing none of complex fretwork and song structuring. This is mixed in with a lot of straight up death metal riffing and Dismember-like use of melody| which gives the album a sense of power and violence that shames their fellow countrymen. Adramelech simply never give you too much of one thing| there's elements of technical death metal| old school Finnish brutality and doomy heaviness| all displayed with an airy| almost black metal atmosphere. There are so many ideas on offer that it never gets stale.This atmosphere is driven by the roomy production with no instrument dominating the sound| and the by the unconventional throaty grunts of the Jarkko Rantanen. Every instrument is audible and clear| leaving enough space to show off the various technical elements that make up about half this album| but without turning it into an in-band dick waving contest. The vocals are quiet and the bass is loud| but this seems like less of a mixing mistake and more of a conscious decision. The loud bass helps drive the grooves through what could otherwise break down into a mess of angular rhythms| and the strangely distant vocals add to the alien quality of the music. This is much like how Antti Boman's burps aid Demilich's atypical sound| but these have the same effect whilst not seeming quite so 'silly'| and pack quite a bit more punch.Musically| Psychostasia is a reasonably technical affair| about a 3rd of it is straight forward old school DM and traditional melodies| so it avoids the technical death metal tag| but the album is quite a challenge to digest fully. It has layers and layers of complex rhythm work to go along with the speedy fretwork to keep an inquisitive minded listener interested for years| and enough stomping riffs to keep your casual headbanger more than entertained. Tempos rise and fall frequently but they do so smoothly| without ever resorting to moronic stop-start “song writing”. This is where the majority of the low end technicality lies| the drumming is not packed with crazy fills| but Rantanen's use of various beats ranging from simplistic old school pounding rhythms| to polyrhythmic double bass patterns| to off-time beats| to blasts and his transitions from one to another are just as impressive as the most complex of fill players. That isn't to say that the leads and riffs aren't absolutely top notch| because they are| but it's the compositional skills which bring it all together which makes this album so good. There simply isn't anything this strange that flows this well. With that said| the leads are all exceptional| usually melodic| but filled with the trademarked off centre melodic patterns| and full of technical flair| again giving the album yet another level that it can be appreciated on.Adramelech's debut is an absolute gem that was somehow lost among the masses of quality output from Finland during the early/mid 90’s| and one that will hopefully be able to thrive with the internet. It's got all of the quirky charm of other obscure albums which have been dug up over the last few years| but it's still fast| catchy and aggressive at the same time.
97,118,Now this is interesting.,0.87,"Here| we have a band| consisting of members from the Finnish death metal band| Demigod. On this album| Adramelech's full-length debut| we hear very similar qualities to the fore-mentioned Demigod. A very interesting album| mixing the black and death metal genres quite harmoniously| and subtely adding harmonics to the thick wall of riffs this album contains. ""PsychoStasia"" is a very dynamic| and interesting album| that may cause the listener to actually *listen* to the album| and appreciate all the complex structures| and melodies that are quite evident here| instead of just banging your head against the wall and getting a well deserved concussion. The music on this album| is ever changing. While staying true to the death metal genre| Adramelech intertwines slow| almost melodic riffing passages| that make ""PsychoStasia"" more obscure than your everyday ""oldschool"" death metal release. Believe me when I say| however| that this style works quite well| and still retains the feeling of a death metal album. The bass is LOUD as fuck| and at times| seems to overpower the other instruments. Don't fret| for this allows for a flowing rhythm| that remains heavy 'till the last beat. One of the guitars will follow along with the drum beat| which is something you don't hear much of anymore. Another guitar will act as the leader| offering up the main riffs to the songs| sometimes going off into a whole new dimension. A very bizarre style to say the least. Vocally| the album is solid. Jarkko Rantanen barks songs about religion| and mythologies| maintaining an agressiveness not always heard within the genre. Though| at times| it seems as if he is standing five feet from the microphone. Some might see this as weak production| but I see it as just another positive influence on the doomy atmosphere surrounding ""PsychoStasia"". The overall production is that which you would expect of a blackened-death metal band| and Adramalech captures it perfectly. For any fans of the death| or black metal genres| try this album out. It's heavy| it's fucked up| it's original| and yet it should contain at least something that anyone could like."
98,119,Epic black/death,0.85,"Adramelech are best known for sharing a couple of members with Demigod. As a result| some dismiss them as the poor man's Demigod. This isn't totally true| for Adramelech do have a style of their own.Comparisons have been drawn to a range of other bands from Massacra to Atrocity - though recorded in 1999| the album sounds more like it is from the first half of the 1990s. Basically| the riffs are in a style halfways between eighties death metal and European early-nineties death| but the song structures (the music's ""skeletons""| so to speak) are far more complex and epic than either of those with each song having a distinct narrative structure.This combination of dynamy and in-your-faceness is perhaps where the main similarity with Demigod is| but there's a serious difference in tone. Where Demigod is mysterious| Adramelech is martial. The tone of the album is more aggressive and destructive| if so in a disciplined rather than feral way than introspective and metaphysical. ""Pure Blood Doom"" also incorporates some black metal elements Demigod don't - mostly the entire epic| mythological feel.The reason this mostly works is that the complexity doesn't ruin the atmosphere or make it difficult to get into. It's not quite as good as ""The Slumber of Sullen Eyes"" but still worth getting."
99,120,Sound of Thousand Albums,0.69,"On this| Adramelech's 3rd full length release| the band has abbandoned the realm of blackened death metal| and opted for a more basic approach to the death metal genre. The riffs are brutal| the drumming is fast| and the vocals are harsh. All you could want from a death metal album right? Hmm....To me| this album is as generic as death metal can get. That's not to say| that this is ALL bad| but considering the band's previous releases| this comes as quite a disappointment. The song structures are heavily simplified| going from the classical influences of ""PsychoStasia""| to a focus on groove| and brutality. The energy is certainly there| but is this really offering anything new to the death metal genre? The vocals are growled much like the vocals of a thousand albums before it| while the riffs seem to speed through the songs as if to say| ""can we stop now? Seinfeld is on"". The drumming is good| but once again| quite generic| and adds nothing to the songs. The lyrics are focused on violence and war. Gee| no band has EVER done that before. Not only this| they are terribly cliched| and look like they were written by a death metal robot.Overall| this is not a bad album| per se| but it has absolutely no originality to it whatsoever. Everything about it is completely generic| and is really nothing you haven't heard before by the countless numbers of death metal bands out there. If you like never-changing growled vocals| basic song structures| heavy riffs| and fast drumming| as well as ridiculous and cliched lyrics| go ahead and give this album a shot. Otherwise| stay away from it| Chances are| you've heard it before anyway."
